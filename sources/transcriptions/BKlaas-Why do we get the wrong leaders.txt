0:22
well thank you thank you very much that was one of the most unique introductions I think I've ever had
0:29
um I'd like to start with this why don't you raise your hand if you think that systems of power around the world are
0:36
mostly getting it right okay so I haven't seen any hands out of
0:42
about a thousand people how about about this one raise your hand if you could excuse me in an instant switch places
0:50
with a politician such that they would take your job and you would have to have their career for the rest of your life
0:58
I see a few hands but not many these are two problems right we have two
1:03
serious problems that nobody who is a normal decent person wants to become a politician or wants to become a leader
1:10
and secondly that we basically are all fed up with the people who are in charge of us now the problems around power have
1:17
been plaguing humans for thousands of years we've made huge technological innovations in almost every area of
1:24
modern society except for this one we are dealing with the exact same questions today that ancient Greeks and
1:30
ancient Romans were dealing with and I think we can do better than that I think we can design better systems and I think
1:35
we can get better people in power so that everybody's hand goes up when I ask you who wants to be a politician and I
1:41
think we can design better systems so we think everyone wants to say yes we've got it right
Who are the wrong leaders
1:46
so what I did in my work is I went around the world and I met with people who are powerful
1:52
I conducted about 500 interviews with former heads of state despots people who ordered torture war criminals Rebels
2:00
people who plotted coups and Generals along with CEOs and leaders in Western societies
2:06
and what I found that was really interesting is that when you think about this group of people they are not normal
2:13
and I don't mean that necessarily as an insult I mean that they're not average they're not representative of the
2:18
population there's something about them and we need to understand that now if you were to imagine meeting a
2:25
zoologist who studied elephants and you said you know so how often do you interact with elephants and they said
2:31
never I've never seen one I've never never actually observed one you'd find that very weird
2:37
and yet a lot of social science doesn't involve actually going and observing and talking to these real breathing people
2:43
who can answer our questions and so I think we need to actually scrutinize understand and get better at
2:51
figuring out what makes these people tick so that we can ensure that nobody likes them ends up in power again this
2:57
is me a couple years ago meeting with the former president of Madagascar one of many people that I met with in my
3:02
travels around the world now the reason that nobody raised their hand in the first question systems of power being
3:09
about right isn't hard to understand we are surrounded by dangerous people in
3:14
positions of immense responsibility and this is not just in foreign far away authoritarian countries like in Russia
Systems of power
3:21
or China it's also where I'm from in the United States Donald Trump's particularly insightful quote behind me
3:27
on the on the screen um and you'll also sympathize with me because I am an American
3:34
and yet I live in the UK so I've had to deal back and forth
3:40
with thinking about which country is more messed up in terms of its democracy right looking back home to the United
3:46
States with this very stable genius and then living in a place where the Prime
3:51
Minister failed to outlast a lettuce and only survived in power for 45 days
3:57
so we have our work cut out for us we have serious problems in our modern societies and the question tonight is
4:02
how can we do better how can we ensure that everyone thinks that the systems of Power are working for them now I will
4:08
say that a lot of the places that I work are much more dystopian than Denmark Denmark is one one of these places where
4:14
you often bring it up as an example of a virtuous and well-run society and I think it deserves that that reputation
4:21
globally to a very large extent but even here when I talk to people they say we
Four questions
4:27
don't have the best among us we have many of the worst Among Us in positions of power how can we get this fixed how
4:32
can we make it better so the question that my book asks is four questions in fact
4:38
and those questions are as follows do worse people get power does power make people worse
4:46
why do we let people control us who clearly have no business being in control why do we allow this and for
4:52
finally how can we ensure that Incorruptible people end up in charge instead or get power
4:58
instead now to begin with this every time I've met someone who has uh the understood
5:05
what I studied basically bad people who do bad things in power they have trotted out some version of this quote the most
5:11
famous quote about power power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely it's a quote from Lord Acton
5:18
it's true but there's a much more complicated much more interesting story that actually is
5:25
more solvable that I'm going to talk about tonight part of this story will be about power corrupting power making
5:30
people worse which it does but we'll also talk about all these hidden factors that are often ignored to
5:36
our own Peril and detriment because the systems around positions of Power are extremely important and they're not just
5:42
important because they affect outcomes they're important because they're the things that you can fix most easily it's
5:49
hard to change the magnetism of power it's hard to change the way that power changes people's psychology and their
5:55
neurology what is easier to change is the systems we design that determine who ends up in the top
Does power corrupt
6:02
so the first question let's start with the easier one does power corrupt the answer is yes
6:08
but let's look at a few detailed examples of this and the poster child for the idea that power corrupts was one
6:14
of the interviews one of the weirdest interviews that I've done uh met this woman a few times
6:20
and her name is ma Anand Sheila if you've seen the Netflix documentary Wild Wild Country you probably recognize
6:26
this person what she did was she was the a sort of an art student in India growing up age
6:33
18 and looking for a bigger meaning in life something Beyond sort of you know the the dystopia of modern society and
6:39
so on so she joined a new age Guru named bhagwan SRI ragnish rajneesh and she
6:45
decided to work for what would develop into a sort of cult and as the group was pushed out of India
6:53
she was tasked with building a international City in Rural Oregon where
6:58
she bought a massive Ranch called Big Muddy Ranch and she turned it into the
7:04
rajnishi's home in the United States so thousands of people descend on this small area in Rural Oregon
7:10
and she develops immense power and it's not just worldly power either
7:16
because at some point the guru takes a vow of silence and so she becomes the voice of the guru this is the kind of
7:22
power that most of us will never experience and it warps her it warps her so much
7:27
that she decides to try to take over the local town because they're not playing ball with what she wants to do so she
7:33
runs a series of American candidates who are members of this sort of new age cult and they take over rajneesh they they
7:40
take over the um the area called Antelope Oregon and they rename it rajneesh param
Rajneesh param
7:46
now rajneesh param is basically run by the this this group but the county starts to make noises
7:53
about saying we're not going to approve your permits we're going to shut you down now there aren't enough people in the
7:59
American side of the the sort of new age cult to take over the county so she needs to come up with a plan B
8:05
and her plan B was this to rig the local election by depressing
8:11
turnout and the way she was going to depress turnout was by poisoning a thousand people
8:16
which is what she did so she is the worst bioterrorist in American history she did a test run for
8:22
the election and she sprinkled along with her henchmen salmonella on a series of salad bars around Rural Oregon and a
8:30
thousand people were poisoned now what's amazing about this story is you have this sort of trajectory
8:35
starting as an 18 year old art student hasn't done anything wrong in her life at that point at that point
8:41
but the question is maybe she was just rotten all along right maybe it wasn't the power that corrupted her
8:47
the problem was when I met her she looked like this and she's running a care home to this
8:52
day in Switzerland so she served time in prison as the worst bioterrorist in American history
8:58
she moved to Switzerland after she was deported and the Swiss government which you know is a reasonable stickler for
9:03
the rules found a uh they found the application without fail and they decided to give her a care home to run
9:10
which she does with vulnerable people and as far as I can tell nothing since then has gone wrong she hasn't done
9:16
anything illegal and so this is the sort of classic case of power corrupting a
9:21
good person takes power and is just warped beyond belief trying to poison people she tried to assassinate various
9:27
officials and so on it was absolutely crazy now the second story that I'll tell you
Stanford Prison Experiment
9:33
is one that some of you will be familiar with if you have read an intro psychology textbook or listened to a popular
9:39
psychology podcast you will probably have heard of the Stanford Prison Experiment if you haven't heard of it
9:45
here's the basics of the prison experiment and I'm going to invert it in a second because I think everything you
9:50
know about it if you do know about it is actually wrong so the gist of the stand for prison
9:55
experiments is this a man named Philip zimbardo converted the basement of the Stanford psychology department into a
10:02
fake jail and then he recruited people for a psychological study of prison life to randomly be assigned whether to be a
10:09
student who would be a prison guard or a prisoner and so the question was what happens when they put on the uniform and they
10:16
become powerful in this fake experiment well what happened was extremely scary because within a couple days the
10:23
prisoners who were just students at Stanford had started abusing and humiliating their prisoners they had
10:29
been physically attacking them so much so that zimbardo's girlfriend at the time shut the experiment down she said
10:35
you have to stop this it's it's it's unethical you can't continue and so the evidence that this produced
10:41
was the idea that if you just put the right person into a prison uniform as a prison guard they'll become corrupt
10:48
they'll abuse the people it's not the person it's the uniform right power corrupts
10:53
there's a problem with this narrative though and it's one that hasn't been noticed very much in the world of psychology or in Social research and
11:00
that said about a decade ago some researchers in Kentucky at a university that gets a lot less
11:06
attention than Stanford they noticed something peculiar about the way that recruitment was done for this study and
Recruitment
11:13
what they found was that the ad said for a psychological study of prison life what they decided to do was to replicate
11:19
the exact wording of the ad except for in half of the University towns they would say for a psychological study and
11:27
in half of the University towns they would say for a psychological study of prison life and then they saw who showed up and they
11:34
did psychometric tests and evaluations of personality types and so on on all the people who responded and what they
11:40
found was that the people who responded to the psychological study of prison life wording were systematically more
11:46
authoritarian abusive Machiavellian and narcissistic and Psychopathic than the
11:52
people who responded to the generic study and so this completely inverts the finding of the Stanford Prison
11:58
Experiment right it's not that people put on the uniform and became corrupt or abusive it's that people who wanted the
12:04
uniform were more likely to be corrupt and abusive in the first place and this inverts the finding it's not that power
12:10
corrupts it's that power attracts the corruptable and that's where the title of my book comes from because I think this is a much bigger effect it's a much
12:17
more important area is that we have this problem of power acting like a magnet to people who should not be in power
Survivorship Bias
12:24
now to understand how this works I'm going to divert your attention away from prisons and politicians for a second to
12:31
World War II there's a man named Abraham vold who was a statistician who who fled from Nazi
12:38
Germany and he ended up working at Columbia in New York Columbia University
12:43
he was enlisted to help with the Allied war effort and they asked him a very simple question they said look we have a
12:48
series of warplanes that have come back from Germany in their bombing runs and they have bullet holes in various places
12:54
throughout the plane we want you to tell us where we should reinforce and what you're seeing here is
13:00
a distribution of where the bullet holes were in red and so some of the generals said we must
13:05
reinforce the wings some said we should do it in the tail put you know reinforce the tail some said in the Middle where
13:11
there's the concentration of bullet holes Abraham vald looked at these airplanes in this hair in this Hangar and said if
13:18
you take any of those three paths you're gonna kill a lot of Pilots and the reason you're going to kill a
13:24
lot of Pilots is because you need to worry about the invisible planes and what he meant by that is that all the
13:29
planes that you could see had made it back from Germany they'd survived they had been able to fly home the ones
13:37
that you couldn't see the ones that were shot in the engines were in Germany they were invisible and this has given rise to a concept
13:43
called survivorship bias it's sometimes also called the caveman effect because it may be the case the cavemen didn't
13:49
really paint in caves that often or live in caves but just that what survived is the stuff that was outside of the
13:55
elements if a caveman painted on a tree it was long gone by the time we were looking at it so the idea of
14:01
survivorship bias is that you have to think about what survives now this matters a lot for power because power
14:07
when we see the people who are powerful the CEOs the politicians Etc they survived three different levels of power
Seeking Power
14:14
they have sought power so you have to seek power in the first place they've obtained power and they've managed to
14:20
stay in power now the third Point may seem less important but many of you have probably not heard of a man named Pedro
14:26
lesgren and the reason you have not heard of him is because he was the president of Mexico for 45 minutes
14:33
now this issue is one where there's a certain kind of person who is really
14:38
obsessed with getting power there's a certain kind of person who is very good at getting power and there's also a
14:44
certain kind of person that is good at staying in power if you have all three of those you're more likely to become
14:50
powerful and what we're selecting for are not necessarily correlated with what's good for governing or good for
14:55
leading a business it's what's good for maintaining power or seeking it in the first place many of you don't really
15:01
care about not being a CEO or being a politician in fact when I asked you to raise your hand most of you would not trade places with a politician because
15:08
of the way the political system works so this is called self-selection bias
SelfSelection Bias
15:13
self-selection bias is tied to power where it's the idea that we wait for people to say I should be powerful right
15:20
we we wait for people to sort of just walk out and say I'm the one who should be in charge that's self-selection bias
15:26
it's rolling out the red carpet to people who are power hungry now when we say power hungry we mean bad
15:33
right I mean power hungry has never been said as a praise an adjective of Praise but what it literally means is someone
15:39
who wants power it is not a very mysterious thing that people who want Power are more likely to end up there
15:45
than the rest of us so these are the invisible planes that I'm talking about the large group of people that are in
15:51
your lives who would be great leaders but never end up in power partly because they didn't want it partly because they
15:57
weren't good at getting it or they lost it when they did obtain it and this is the Paradox that we find ourselves with I mean when I think about my own life
16:03
I'm sure when you think about your lives the people around you are good and decent you find them to be people who
16:09
are ethical concerned with others care about public service very often and then you look up in society and you say
The Dice Study
16:16
wait a minute why is it different right self-selection bias is is one of the key answers
16:22
however this is always going to be a universal aspect of power right we're always going to have self-selection bias
16:27
so what do we do about it well this is where systems are really really important and the way you design a
16:33
system and tweak it and adjust it can determine who ends up on top now I'm going to tell you a story now
16:39
that makes Denmark look very good so there's a study that I write about in my book which is called the dice study
16:45
it's a very simple idea they take students and they give them a dice and they say roll it 42 times and write down
16:53
your score each time but here was the catch every time you roll a six we'll give you some money
16:59
now we're also not going to watch you roll the dice and we're not going to watch you write down your scores so you could lie but of course with with
17:07
statistical methods it's pretty easy to tell when someone is lying systematically right so one participant
17:13
in India bonus points for how Brazen he was wrote down 42 sixes in a row
17:19
um good for him for trying now what was fascinating about this was they then looked at who lied on the dice rolls and
17:26
what their future career Ambitions were in India where the civil service is
17:32
known for having a track record of bribery and graft where you can get rich by extorting people the people who lied
17:38
on their dice rolls were the ones who wanted to go into the Civil Service completely a very very strong
17:44
correlation a pathway from lying in this in this experiment to wanting to be a civil servant they repeated the study
17:51
elsewhere around the world and one of the places they repeated was in Denmark and the results were exactly flipped
17:57
what they found is that the people who lied on their dice rolls wanted to go to business and the people who who uh very
18:04
very honestly reported their their dice rolls in Denmark wanted to go into the Civil Service which is not notorious for
18:09
bribery and graft so this aspect of the the study shows you that it's the exact same study right
18:16
and there's there's nothing really systematically different about the people it's that when they saw the
18:22
incentives that Civil Service equals bribery in India they thought okay yeah the unscrupulous Among Us will
18:29
self-select so there's an intersection between self-selection bias and how systems operate and the way that this is
18:35
most clearly manifesting itself in the best example that I've come across is unfortunately in policing particularly
18:43
in the United States now I grew up in Minneapolis which
18:48
unfortunately is the city where George Floyd was murdered so this is a very important problem in my hometown
18:53
and what I'm showing you on the screen is the opening screenshot from a recruitment video for a police
19:00
department in Doraville Georgia is a town of ten thousand people outside
19:05
of Atlanta and what this is is an image of the Punisher who's a vigilante anti-hero comic book uh villain hero who
19:13
tortures criminals this is the opening screen to a Police recruitment video okay the next screen
Police Recruitment
19:20
doesn't get much better it's a tank and it's a SWAT team and what they do is
19:25
they drive around and they open the hatch and they toss out smoke grenades they get out in military fatigues and
19:32
then they attack these unseen targets and they shoot them and then they get back in the tank and the entire thing is
19:38
set to death metal music right now when we watch that video I hope almost
19:45
all of us will say okay I'm definitely not signing up for that Police Department right this is
19:50
super weird and I do not want to be a part of this but the thing is that there's a certain cross-section of the population that
19:57
looks at that video and says yeah I want to be the Punisher this will be perfect this is my career path right those are
20:04
the people who apply the people who think policing is about helping little old ladies cross the street don't apply
20:09
because they look at this and they think okay I don't want to drive around in a literal tank in my small suburb right
20:16
so there's a self-selection problem now I know this is a little bit of an extreme example but there's multiple examples
20:22
throughout the United States and the US government actually made this worse because they used Surplus military
20:28
equipment from Afghanistan and Iraq and they gave it to local police departments so they ended up using a lot of the
20:34
military equipment and the people who wanted to play with military equipment signed up for policing
The Alternative
20:40
so what's the alternative well the alternative is what New Zealand did and what New Zealand did that was very
20:45
clever is they thought to themselves very carefully about sex self-selection bias they said if we represent policing
20:51
differently maybe we'll get different recruits so these are a few screenshots I'm going to show you from a video that
20:57
the New Zealand Police produced the cost of a few million dollars very very cheap for what it ended up yielding
21:04
and these videos are funny if you want to after the talk look it up on YouTube they're very very funny videos and what
21:11
they show is a demographically diverse police force lots more women and ethnic
21:16
minorities in the video than you would expect of course in the Doraville Georgia recruitment video everyone was a
21:22
white man and on top of this there's various gags throughout the video so you have a officer stopping to help a man cross the
21:29
street in the next frame which I don't have on on screen he stops and a man with a Boombox plays some music and they
21:35
dance together and they're all chasing this unseen perpetrator right this Criminal Who
21:40
they're going to hunt down and in the final scene of the video they catch him and it turns out to be a border collie
21:46
who's stolen a woman's purse now the difference between the tank and
21:52
the Punisher and the Border Collie is summed up very very well by the final screenshot of the video do you care
21:59
enough to be a cop right I mean it's the exact polar opposite now what what happened lo and
22:06
behold when they tested the recruits that they got they were totally different and they were different in a
22:12
few key ways first off there were way more of them right so people who didn't think of themselves as police officers
22:18
to begin with started to think I do care enough to be a cop I could do this
22:24
so they applied all of a sudden the ranks have expanded of the applicants that means that you can be more
22:29
selective and pick better officers secondly the number of women and ethnic minorities shot through the roof who
22:35
applied for the police and this was important because there's strain tensions between for example the Maori Community the ethnic indigenous
22:42
community in New Zealand and the police force and violence decreased so for a few million dollars of just
22:48
carefully thinking about how you represent a position of power they solved a significant chunk of their
22:54
problem they got better officers and that's a self-fulfilling prophecy where you start to have a virtuous cycle right
23:00
because the officers in the force are people who are public service oriented when somebody else comes into the police
23:06
they teach them how to perform Public Service in the Doraville Police Department it's the exact opposite they
23:13
say look when we get called Suit Up Get Your Gun ready we're an occupying Army right so you have aspects of this where
23:21
they're knock-on effects that last for years and years and years and all they had to do was think carefully about the
23:27
Recruitment and yet what do we do most the time we recruit on autopilot we do it the same way we did in the past we
23:33
don't think about representing power any differently now here comes the awkward part of my
Are we to blame
23:38
talk it's about us are we to blame so we live in democracies right we have
23:45
Democratic responsive governments that are supposed to do what we say and they're supposed to be elected by us
23:51
and yet consistently we pick snakes in suits we pick people who we know are not good
23:58
and we do this for a variety of reasons and one of the things that happens is that we make irrational decisions when
24:04
it comes to who we choose to be in power now this has been proven in a variety of different studies so one of the ones
24:11
that that really stuck out to me was a study that shows how early on this effect happens
24:17
there's a study where it's been replicated it's very solid science where what they did was they showed children a
24:23
set of images between two people's faces and they said okay imagine you are about
24:29
to have an imaginary ship and you need to decide who will be the captain of your boat right these are these are kids
24:36
but all you have to go on is the face you look at two faces and you point and you say that's the captain okay
24:42
what the kids didn't know was that the faces were not a random assortment the faces were the winner of an election and
24:49
the runner-up of an election so the person who wanted the person who came in second and what they found was that
24:54
overwhelmingly in the significant majority of the time the children picked the winner right for no reason other
25:00
than their face that was it so already there's an irrationality built in and when they did this with adults it was
25:06
even more pronounced the effect was even more pronounced it's been replicated in different contexts U.S Governors French
25:11
elections Etc we are making decisions based on who should lead us on things that are
25:17
incredibly stupid and some of them are just faces right some of them are how people look do they look like a leader
25:22
to us now the problem about somebody looking like a leader to us is that the people who currently are our leaders are
25:29
not representative of the population if you look at Fortune 500 CEOs the CEOs of the biggest 500 companies in the
25:35
United States you see there's a massive SKU right I mean just look at the one under white men people who look like me
25:42
30 of the US population 86 percent of the CEOs it depends on when you count it but very
25:48
often there are more CEOs named John in the ftse 100 in the UK than there are CEOs who are women
25:54
and you have aspects where you look at other minority groups I mean no black women six and a half percent of the
26:00
population under Latinos 18 of the population two percent of the CEOs and
26:05
so on and so forth so what happens is you have these problems where you first
26:11
off have any rationality that exists and then it's compounded by social biases so
26:16
who looks like a leader is partly ingrained in our psyche which I'll talk about in a second and partly ingrained
26:21
by how we're socialized by who our current crop of leaders are and this is why we have to be so careful about how
26:27
we Design Systems of power because we have to counteract these things we have to acknowledge our stupid biases and fix
26:33
them now our biases are not just social and not just learned in our lifetimes they
26:40
are tied to evolutionary mismatches about how our brains have evolved for very different environments from the
26:45
from the modern systems that we find ourselves in this evolutionary mismatch hypothesis is
26:51
a Hallmark of evolutionary psychology and what the proponents of it argue is that for much of human societies you
26:57
know vast expanse we're talking hundreds of thousands of years when you were in a moment of Crisis
27:03
there actually was a survival advantage that was tied to picking a physically large man as your leader and this was
27:10
often because you faced a threat from the outside you needed a warrior you needed a hunter and therefore there was
27:16
actually a tie between survivability and physically large men this is no longer true right it's absolutely no longer
27:23
true some of our best leaders in the world who also by the way have willingly given up power in ways that men often
27:28
don't are women and yet this cognitive bias still exists we've done tests psychologists and so on
27:36
have done tests where they look at hypothetical leaders and they Prime people they say imagine there's a war on
27:42
or a pandemic or a famine now pick the leader and what they find is that in those instances of Crisis people
27:49
systematically gravitate towards physically large men it's incredibly stupid it makes no sense but the data
27:55
show that it happens right so we can either pretend it's not there or we can
28:00
think about it carefully and how to counteract it now some leaders know that this is the case we call these people
28:06
strong men or strong men there's no coincidence it's they're physically strong men and they like to
28:12
activate this latent part of our brains that has evolved to gravitate towards people like them as a way to amplify
28:19
their persuasive appeal to their public what happens every time Vladimir Putin feels like he might be in trouble he
28:26
poses shirtless he poses shirtless again and he poses shirtless again in fact he
28:31
inspires art of imposing shirtless so when you think about these these
28:37
aspects there is a a reason for this it's not irrational now I do not think that Vladimir Putin is reading
28:43
psychology literature and making his adjustments to his leadership style accordingly but I do think he's tapped into this aspect of our psychology that
28:50
is incredibly incredibly stupid and yet does actually affect our decision making now imagine any other context in which
28:58
this would happen imagine that you have a dentist that's the leading dentist in Copenhagen and you're about to get your
29:05
wisdom teeth removed on the operating table and they rip open their shirt and show their prowess I mean you would
29:11
report them to the board immediately right you would get another dentist and yet we have in politics this this idea
29:17
that this is like part of what it might mean to be a politician these shows of machismos and sort of strength
29:23
and then we have another problem I know there's a lot of problems but there's another one
Psychopaths
29:28
Psychopaths now there may be a link to Vladimir Putin I can't clinically diagnose him but I will say that psychopaths are a
29:36
real problem when it comes to positions of power now a psychopath is someone who might
29:41
not look like a psychopath one of the things that is a characteristic of psychopathy is that they're very very
29:46
good at blending in and looking like everybody else and they have three traits in particular
29:53
which form What's called the dark Triad the dark Triad is as you can see on the screen composed of narcissism so extreme
30:01
egotism machiavellianism where someone is a strategic thinker where the ends justifies the means for them especially
30:08
in getting power and psychopathy or being a psychopath now these are not good traits to exist
30:14
in common and unfortunately they correlate very often with each other now if you think about why they're not good
30:19
in addition to the fact that you wouldn't want a psychopath in charge and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a second
30:24
think about what they end up doing there's this drive for power remember the Abraham vold story about the airplanes and and the the World War II
30:31
survivorship bias psychopaths are obsessed with power over other people okay that's seeking power
30:39
machiavellians are very strategic thinkers who are good at getting what they want that's getting power and
30:46
narcissists are so obsessed with their ego and how others perceive them that they actually can detect threats because
30:52
they understand when they're getting unpopular with their colleagues so that's maintaining power it's the perfect cocktail so you have this
30:59
cocktail of psychological traits that is highly correlated with ending up in power and unfortunately not with
31:05
wielding it well depending on the study that you look at it's measured different ways there's
31:11
different scales and different checklists and so on for psychopathy the number of people who are in power
31:17
who are psychopaths is somewhere between four times and 25 times the General Public
31:22
this is not good right this is a very very bad thing for us because even though they may be ruthlessly
31:28
calculating individuals who sometimes can be logical thinkers in those moments of crisis when things are really on the
31:35
line and change is happening rapidly that's when empathy is most important it's when you have to care about other
31:40
people and they don't have it in fact psychopaths are really fascinating in how they don't have empathy
31:46
they have something that's wrong with their brains in the section of the brain called the amygdala regulates emotions and there's various discussions about
31:52
what causes psychopathy there's a discussion where some people think it's you're born with it some people think
31:57
it's environmental factors and some people think it's a combination of the two
32:03
but what is clear is that when you put psychopaths in MRI scanners and you look
32:08
at their brains while you show them extremely disturbing videos so in this one study I'm thinking of they show them
32:14
videos of children and animals suffering in really horrific ways the Psychopaths brains were blank they
32:20
didn't react didn't bother them When they scanned normal people They lit up like a firework and they asked to get
32:26
out of the MRI scanner please however this is the crucial bit
32:31
there was a sort of little stroke of insight that one of the researchers had and she said okay what happens if I tell the
32:38
Psychopaths to imagine what it would be like to care about those people imagine that you have empathy put them back in
32:44
the scanner re-scan the brains turn on the videos normal they look effectively normal and what
32:51
this means is that Psychopaths can pass as normal people when they need to however some are not very good at this
32:58
and this is where you get to divide between the unsuccessful Psychopaths and the successful Psychopaths the unsuccessful psychopaths are not
33:04
disciplined where do they end up prism they kill people they abuse people and
33:09
they commit crimes so there's a very high proportion of the incarcerated population for violent crimes for
33:15
example that are psychopaths and those are people who when they needed to be disciplined when they needed to pass like the rest of us they couldn't they
33:22
couldn't turn it off they couldn't up regulate the empathy that they needed to successful psychopaths in a variety of
33:28
different studies of what is called snakes in suits they're in boardrooms and they're in politics
33:33
and they're people who understand how to turn on the empathy to make shows of it
33:38
when they need to to act like normal people and yet they don't they don't actually feel it and this is a huge
33:44
problem it's a huge problem because it links again to the system what I talked about before being on autopilot
33:51
when you talk to experts on psychopathy is I have many many around the world what they always say without fail are
33:58
these two words Psychopaths yield superficial charm superficial charm means in a short
34:05
period not for years and years and years but for a short period they can make them they can make them very likable to
34:12
you right they can make people like them that's bad news for us because the way we've designed promotion and and sort of
34:19
election to power is effectively the job interview 45-minute exercise can you make someone like you in 45 minutes
34:27
elections you're never going to actually meet these people most of them but you have to get an impression of them that
34:32
is superficially Charming we've designed systems that amplify these traits they reward them
34:39
because they don't have to show effective performance they have to show likability
34:44
so we're systematically downgrading the appeal for a person who's an introvert who has a really hard time speaking in
34:50
public and so on and we're amplifying traits that are not necessarily tied to Servant leadership and public service
34:56
and good uh good leaders but are just tied to superficial charm so these are
35:02
not areas where we can just sort of say let's just do what we did before right we have to think much more carefully
35:09
about how we Design Systems in this realm and when it comes to Psychopaths you
35:14
know there's still a minority it's it's very unlikely that your boss is a psychopath
35:20
maybe some of you um but it is it is statistically unlikely still problem is
35:26
that they do disproportionate damage right so when you think about psychopaths in power one of the
35:32
arguments that sometimes is made around them and you'll see books there's a book called The Wisdom of psychopaths for
35:37
example by Kevin Dutton and what he argues is that we have to find a place for these people why not just put them
35:43
in high stress situations because one of the things that Psychopaths have that the rest of us don't is they are very
35:49
very calm when an emergency is going on and when things normally would fluster the rest of us a psychopath doesn't have
35:56
their heart rate Elevate they don't get an emotional response Etc so what what Dutton argues I think persuasively
36:02
is around the idea of for example a bomb defusal expert in the military I could see the argument here a little bit
Psychopaths and surgeons
36:10
but I think he goes a little bit too far when he talks about surgeons so it's true that a surgeon is under
36:17
stress under immense pressure and may need to be a cold calculating individual but I put it to you this way you go to
36:23
the doctor you go to the surgery for your your operation and they say don't worry you're in good hands we've got a psychopath today
36:30
I mean nobody's going to go you're going to run out of that room right so the problem is that when it really counts we
36:36
don't think this way and when it really counts if we're if we're not willing to have somebody with a scalpel operate on
36:41
one person why could we possibly tolerate entire societies being run Often by Psychopaths and this is
36:48
particularly problematic in worse systems right so I can't speak about I'm not a clinical psychologist psychiatrist
36:54
I can't speak about Denmark Psychopaths what I can say is that when it comes to
37:00
dictators I would bet a lot of money that very very many of them are psychopaths and the reason why I would
37:06
bet that is because another trait that they have which makes them destructive in power is they discount risk they
37:12
don't think risk applies to them because they're smarter than everybody else that's what they think anyway right now
37:18
this is a problem for dictators because dictators often die in office or they
37:24
get jailed or they get forced into Exile very few dictators have a cushy retirement and what that means is that when you
37:30
think about entering power in a dictatorial system you know some of the people that I've spoken to former heads of state and Thailand and Madagascar and
37:37
all around the world those people have to think well that
37:43
happened to my predecessor but it would never happen to me now that's a psychopath trait and so when those
37:49
people do inevitably get toppled and end up getting killed or jailed or exiled they're surprised but they've discounted risk now in our societies discounting
37:57
risk might might not be necessary to enter politics it may be but it's not it's not as crucial as in an
38:03
authoritarian regime but when psychopaths are in those moments of crunch time
38:08
they think I'll roll the dice the problem is they're rolling the dice with our lives with our economies CEOs
38:14
making bad decisions getting into money laundering scandals sorry if that hits too close to home now
38:20
in addition to this you have issues where you know these these problems are are things where you can put safeguards
38:27
in them because what I've talked about so far is issues related to all sorts of areas
38:33
of power and they're multifaceted right the self-selection bias who seeks power the
38:39
machiavellians being better at getting power the psychopaths over-represented in power corrupting Demand on Shields of the
38:46
world so we've got a lot of problems how are we going to fix it
38:51
well there's a lot of different ways we can tackle this problem and I don't have uh you know unlimited time but I am
38:56
going to cover a few that I think are worth considering one of them is exploiting the power of
Exploiting randomness
39:03
Randomness in fact two of them exploit the power of randomness and I'm going to tell you a story that's really interesting from the New York
39:09
Police Department I interviewed the the former head of internal affairs at the NYPD and he's a man who basically his
39:15
livelihood is about catching crooked cops right he's trying to expose people who are stealing or beating up people or
39:22
using too much violence in the NYPD and what he designed was an ingenious ingenious tactic that I think we should
39:29
use much more widely he designed what were called Integrity tests
39:34
so what he would do is he'd rent an apartment in New York City and this would be the fake crime scene
39:41
the fake crime scene would dispatch an officer and they would say look we've just been tipped off we think there's
39:46
some money and some drugs in this place there's nobody there we need you to go and Survey the scene and wait for backup
39:53
to arrive but nobody's been there yet now when the officer would arrive there would be let's say twenty thousand
40:00
dollars on the table in cash there'd also be a whole bunch of drugs with a high street value
40:05
what the officer didn't know is that the whole building was wired up with cameras and microphones
40:12
and what they were doing is they were trying to see what does this officer do they do they take the money do they just report it as twenty thousand and the
40:18
exact number of bags of drugs on the table and so on some of the time the officers said I
40:25
found fourteen thousand dollars and they took six thousand home with them now when that happened these
40:30
officers were arrested or fired but here's the crucial bit
40:37
they only did about 500 Integrity tests through this entire year that they started the pilot
40:43
they did a survey of officers in the NYPD and they said were you the subject of an Integrity test this year did you
40:49
go to a fake crime scene 6 000 officers said yes what that means is that 5500 12 times as
40:57
many as the real number thought that they were at setup crime scenes when they were at real ones and everybody
41:03
else in the NYPD thought they could be at a fake crime scene anytime they responded to a call
41:08
so with just 500 sting operations against these crooked cops the entire force became better
41:13
because all of them feared that it was a setup it was a possibility right you didn't need to make every cop go through
41:18
the test you just need to make it so that every so often one would and every so often they catch word of
41:24
the cop being fired because they stole money the rates of abuse plummeted they even did some of these Integrity tests
41:29
which imagine this is your job you would provoke an officer to try to hit you
41:35
so you would be posing as a sort of Civilian and you'd be insulting them and you'd be trying to get them to hit you
41:41
and if they did they'd be fired right now these Integrity tests again very often the police officers would
41:47
sometimes hit real civilians but of course in these issues uh that that rate declined as well because they
41:53
feared being exposed an area where the power of Randomness is very helpful is with
42:00
beating the self-selection problem this is an image of What's called the claritarian which is from ancient Athens
42:07
and it was effectively a way of developing a citizen assembly it was sort of like jury duty they had various
42:12
rows in the claritarian you'd put in your little trinket that was for you and if they drew your row you had to be
42:19
someone who was governing Society for that period of time random selection now I don't think this
42:25
is called by the way in political science we call this sortition I don't think sortation is a good idea to replace politicians and the reason I
42:31
don't think it's a good idea to replace them is because there are actually things that a lifetime of being a politician does teach you
42:38
and some of those things are very technical right so if you have a nuclear Test Ban Treaty or you're dealing with a geopolitical crisis it's actually good
42:45
that some of the people who are making decisions know some of the background however I do think we should do random
42:52
selection for oversight and what I mean by this is that you randomly take the same number of
42:59
people who are in your Parliament your Congress as it were and you give them the exact same questions
43:04
you give them exactly the same access to experts and you say what would you decide now what you've taken out is
43:11
you've taken out the money you've taken out the power for its own sake you've taken out the self-selection bias you've
43:17
taken out the lobbying and you've taken out the re-election many of the things that warp our decisions
43:22
now even if these people couldn't actually choose for us they couldn't change the taxes they couldn't decide whether to send weapons to Ukraine or
43:29
whatever it was of the day what would be really fascinating is imagine you're a journalist and you're
43:34
interviewing a politician on one of the Sunday news programs and you say you know it's really
43:40
interesting that you've decided to award this contract to this group because when we asked the randomly
43:46
assorted selection of citizens they didn't do anything like that they had a totally different answer and now it's provided some oversight a
43:53
check saying look you know the ordinary people answer this question very easily they compromise they come up with a
43:58
solution it's pragmatic why can't you and that aspect would put pressure on the politicians right so between the
44:06
random selection for oversight and this aspect I think we can get a lot a lot
44:12
done in positions of power and by the way when it comes to Integrity tests I know this is a slightly zany idea but I
44:18
believe it would work I think we should do sting operations for politicians if it's good enough for cops why isn't it
44:24
good enough for politics try to get the best lobbyists try to get a crooked deal through have a journalist organize a
44:30
fake company in the UK where I live there was a huge amount of waste of money around the pandemic because
44:36
conservative members of the government were giving contracts to their friends to procure masks and other PPE when they
44:43
had no track record of providing this stuff now imagine just one time the times of
44:49
London had set up a fake company had greased the wheels with the lobbyist got a politician to agree to give the
44:55
contract every future procurement would be scary because the possibility that this was a
45:01
setup would exist you wouldn't have to do it repeatedly you'd have to do it once and I think these areas this healthy
45:06
dose of fear is something we need to instill in people who are at the very top of society I think the same can be true for CEOs by the way
Seeking out leaders
45:13
now the other thing that I want to talk about is how we need to seek out leaders rather than waiting for them
45:21
many of you will know people who have a track record of leadership maybe it's unsung heroes of your Society maybe it's
45:27
people who have worked on a small stage not a big one but they've had a track record of success
45:32
and they don't want to be politicians they don't want to be CEOs and I can understand that right I mean it's a very
45:37
very awful and ruthless game to to be at the top levels of power but we need them we need these people
45:45
so the question is how do we get them well what's really bizarre I used to work in politics in the U.S I worked in
45:50
a campaign for governor of my home state I was a the deputy campaign manager for that campaign
45:56
and what's really striking about politics is they invest a tiny
46:01
proportion of money in candidate recruitment and the reason they do this is very understandable there's a long
46:08
line of people already there why do you need to spend money to recruit when you've got a line of 10 people who want to be in the job now those 10 people are
46:15
power hungry and they're probably not the best people for the job and when you think about why we have elections where you vote for people where you're like I
46:22
don't want either of them uh that's part of this candidate recruitment problem so what you need to do is you need to
46:27
invest in recruiting people with a track record of leadership who do not think of themselves as politicians
46:33
and on top of this you need to ask a simple question of people who want to be in power the question I I got asked by a few
46:39
people who do interviews for candidates or who work in you know various aspects of high-level business what question
46:46
would you ask someone who wants to be powerful and I have a very simple answer what do you want the power for and what
The power hungry
46:54
would cause you to step down after you'd achieved it and the reason that question is so
46:59
effective is because people who actually seek power the power hungry Among Us do not see Power as a means to an end they
47:07
see Power as a goal so they they get completely flustered by this question they don't know what to say
47:12
they hang on for as long as they can right I mean very very rarely do you have politicians who just say well I did
47:18
my four years that was a good time we got what we wanted done I'm out right they think about it as how long can I
47:23
stay how long can I cling to this I'll go kicking and screaming when the Scandal finally hits
47:28
so the people who can answer that question without missing a beat those are the people you want to charge the people who don't want Power are also the
47:34
people you want to charge they're the invisible airplanes of our society they're the people who understand that
47:40
power should be a burden it should not be a calling it should be difficult it should hurt you when you
47:45
make decisions because decisions of the top levels of leadership are difficult they cause people pain if you're a prime
47:52
minister or president of a country you are hurting people now you may be making the best decision but you're still going to cause problems
47:59
for a lot of people in your society and if you have a properly functioning amygdala that should keep you up at night
48:04
so when you think about it power is not something that's supposed to be a reward it's supposed to be a price but it's the
48:10
price that you pay for a good Society and we need people who feel like I will take on that price for some time I will
48:17
do it because I care about my fellow citizens I will do it because I think I can make the world just a little bit
48:22
better and I can't say it much better than the quote from my one of my favorite writers
48:29
Douglas Adams who says it is a well-known fact that those people who most want to rule people are those least
48:35
suited to do it anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job
The systems
48:43
and this is true when you think about what we actually are selecting for we're selecting for
48:48
people who want Power we're also doing things like what skill set do you have can you evade a tough
48:54
question the people who have made tough questions survive people who answer questions honestly and
48:59
show their flaws get destroyed right so we we're so we're selecting over and
49:04
over and over for things that are not tied to leadership but are tied to being slippery tied to being self-serving tied
49:11
to being narcissistic and tied to being powerful for the sake of power
49:16
and I think this is the the area of of our modern societies that we have to focus more attention on is is the
49:22
systems when you open the the newspaper you endlessly get disappointed right
49:28
there's terrible news often in the news and what you see are often a series of scandals powerful people Behaving Badly
49:36
but what we do as a society that's not a smart response to this is we condemn the
49:41
individual and move on oh that person was corrupt let's replace them oh that person was corrupt and
49:47
abused power let's replace them we think about the tip of the iceberg we think about the planes in front of us we think
49:53
about the people who are powerful now who we can see and the problem with that approach is that we're just going to keep on
49:58
replicating this world right I mean I have literally never met and maybe there'll be somebody amongst you who who
50:04
will come up to me after the talk and be the first person because we are in Denmark after all but I've I've never
50:10
met someone who said to me what's the point of your work we get it right I'm happy with the people on top I'm
50:16
happy with the people who are in charge I think the system is working just fine so even in one of the most prosperous
50:22
Societies in the world like in Denmark this is a play we can obviously do better and I think there's a widespread uh sort
50:30
of view that the the people in charge of us are not fit for leadership so the question is what do we do condemn
50:36
the individual or condemn the system and it doesn't mean you need to say the system is all bad it means that you need
50:42
to think creatively about engineering a system right what we what we basically do instead is we inherit systems we
50:48
inherit them and we think that's how it's done that's the way power works you have this this structure we've done it
50:54
for 50 years and to which I say yeah and for 50 years you've been unhappy with the leaders
51:00
so you have to be creative about designing and Engineering outcomes that are going to attract and promote the
51:05
best Among Us so what I'll close and leave you with is the idea the optimistic idea
51:11
that we can do better I'm not naive I know this is going to be an incredibly uphill battle very powerful very rich
51:17
people do not want the system to change they do not want to be ousted from power right they want the status quo
51:24
so it's going to be an uphill battle and we will always have problems of self-selection it's part of the nature
51:30
of power we will always have problems with power corrupting it's part of the nature of power if the ancient Greeks
51:35
dealt with it we're going to deal with some of these Echoes too but do we really think that we couldn't do better I think that we could and I
51:42
think what I would suggest to you is if you can try to do a small Act of
51:48
leadership in your community the Ripple effects of that are really profound I ended up interested in politics as a
51:54
political scientist because my mom ran for school board when I was eight years old she was unhappy with the direction of the school system and she said I'm
52:01
not going to make any money there's no glory in this but I can volunteer my time effectively and I can try to make
52:07
it a little bit better and not only did that have Ripple effects for the next generation of students who went to a better school system it had Ripple effects for me
52:13
because I found the sort of inspiring aspect of someone who genuinely cared working in politics and these small
52:20
aspects of change really do add up because the pipeline of current leaders at the local level become the pipeline
52:26
