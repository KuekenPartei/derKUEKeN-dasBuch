are the causes different for animals and modern people you look at the neurons under a
0:46
microscope and you cannot tell the difference the same chemicals are being used the same circuitry this is a part
0:55
of the brain that is a hundred million years old and it's exactly the same and you threaten a human and you threaten a
1:02
monkey and they're both likely to become aggressive and you make them afraid and they are more likely to mistake
1:08
something neutral for something being aggressive wow it's exactly the same but
1:13
then you look at the differences chimpanzees murder each other they use
1:20
weapons they will build logs that they use to kill each other they will have
1:25
organized the violence against each other just like us but no chimp has ever
1:31
killed another chimp over ideology over religion over arguments about economic
1:38
systems you can be violent as a chimp or
1:44
a baboon to the individual in the next Valley because they're trying to take over your
1:49
territory you're trying to take over theirs or whatever we can kill somebody and we never even
1:56
see their face because we're in an airplane 30 000 feet up in the air and
2:01
we press a button or in the United States with drone Warfare you have
2:07
people sitting there in an air-conditioned room with music playing and they're relaxing and having a fine
2:13
time and they press a button and somebody in Afghanistan is blown up by a
2:18
myth and what we have with humans is we can take the exact same circuitry
2:26
as any other animal out there and then we use it in ways that are crazy you
2:33
read a book from Authority a hundred years ago and you feel anger at a
2:39
character in there you watch a movie and your blood is boiling and they're not
2:45
real they're just they're computer generated images and such that's the
2:50
thing about us we use the same circuitry and then we use it in ways that no other
2:55
animal can dream of talk to your mind more than human conflict Wars
3:00
revolutions homicide and mostly of a biological character something we have
3:06
already talked about or rather a social one cultural um they're they're one and the same
3:13
culture and biology and genes and evolution all work
3:20
interconnected with each other how do they rat figure out who's a friend who
3:27
you cooperate with and defend who is an outsider who you're willing to attack
3:32
it's built around is this a close relative is that a stranger how does a
3:38
rat know who's a close relative or stranger it's through pheromones olfactory information a rat can smell a
3:46
stranger and tell is this a half brother is this the first cousin is this the
3:52
14th cousin and this is the case with most species out there we don't do that
3:58
human don't have sensory recognition of relatives we have to think about it
4:04
we have to think is this someone who seems like me is this someone who looks
4:11
like me who prays like me who eats like me who does any of those things and as
4:18
soon as you have humans having to think about who counts as an us and who counts
4:24
as a them we can be manipulated by the people in power
4:30
and be manipulated in deciding another group is so different from us they don't
4:37
even count as human and it doesn't even count when you murder that
4:42
or you can have propaganda making it seem so much like the stranger is your
4:49
brother because you're both wearing the same uniform and you would give up your
4:54
life for this person as soon as we get to humans it is very easy to manipulate
5:00
us and every good dictator knows how to do this
5:05
and that's the history the Nazis knew how to do that with the Jews every
5:11
poster showing Jews as rats as Vermin the Hutu and Rwanda making it with two
5:19
T's every picture of them as cockroaches Western Europe doing this with Muslim
5:26
immigrants they're a cancer they're a cancer growing in our Nations now every
5:32
single one of those if you want to make somebody hate another group so much that
5:38
they hardly even count as human to them have the parts of your brain activate
5:43
like you were looking at an insect you were looking at a rodent you were
5:49
looking at a wound full of maggots crawling there if you can get that part of the brain activating and somebody
5:56
when they are thinking about them those themes are not even going to count as humans anymore
6:04
what is happening to a man biologically this feeling isn't known to me but there
6:10
might be an explanation to that when you take over a territory of another country and your population goes well Russia
6:18
takes over Crimea and you feel good about that what is
6:23
this once again I think a key issue is making somebody feel afraid enough
6:32
we will give up our lives for our family members in the military we will give up
6:39
our lives for somebody who feels like a family member and if the outside feels
6:44
threatening enough because they are or because of propaganda
6:50
your aggressiveness is out of love for your people is out of I mean I I fully
6:59
believe that lots of people in Russia believe that Ukraine can destroy Russia
7:04
Ukraine where Russia is like what 20 times the size and the military and all
7:09
of that because NATO could come in and all of that that it's possible for Gigantic Russia to sit there and feel as
7:18
if our very existence is threatened by these other people and when you get
7:23
somebody thinking that way our very existence the lifestyle that we love the
7:30
people that we love the culture that we love all of that if you feel like that
7:35
is being threatened you're not even thinking about them when you kill them all you're thinking about is you and
7:43
your people who form us I do get it that according to oral for a dictator it is
7:49
beneficial to keep his people in the state of War to have an external enemy because it's easier to manage the
7:56
population friendship is supposed to be a much more pleasant thing we feel good living in
8:04
peace is more pleasurable than making War still we seem to easily give up the
8:10
idea of friendship well if we speak about the relationship of Russia and the Ukraine we readily give up the idea of
8:17
friendship and accept the idea of War why do we need this emotion this is so
8:23
weird people it is easier to make somebody feel afraid
8:29
than it is to make them feel safe or to make them feel generous
8:37
or we have evolved to be much better at defense than giving up defense there's
8:46
there's a wonderful psychological test um where you give someone a story
8:53
King has a subject come in and says you need to go on this long journey and
9:00
bring this back or whatever and if you bring it back I will give you a huge reward and if you come back without it I
9:07
will kill you and you take people and sit them down and you give them a version of the story where they bring
9:15
back the item and the King kills them anyway or they come back without the
9:21
item and the King let them live and more complicated versions people are much
9:27
much better at figuring out if somebody has acted more aggressively than they
9:33
were supposed to than if somebody acted more generously than they're supposed to it's a skewing
9:40
with that and you see the same thing in monkeys we've evolved it is easier to make us
9:46
feel afraid because that's a good thing for surviving than to make us feel like
9:51
we are going to gamble everything by reaching out to strangers and say
9:58
come be our friends and again that is the good strategy of
10:05
every dictator and filled with propaganda um I am told in Russia that propaganda
10:12
related to the war is that in eastern Ukraine in the area where people are
10:19
Russian sympathizers that Ukrainian troops went in and crucified a small boy
10:26
the son of one of these leaders and like hammered him up and left him there to
10:31
die and there was absolutely no evidence for this but this is exactly
10:37
how you get people to decide both people are animals and they hardly even counters
10:47
um
10:53
and it is much much easier to make us decide that a neutral group they're
10:59
animals who threaten us and to make them decide that this neutral group is just
11:05
like us and we should bring them in we have
11:10
evolved to be very sensitive to threat and lots of people know how to take
11:16
advantage of that is
11:34
there any scientific research that proves that one nation or people is more
11:40
perceptive to propaganda than another that's a great question probably
11:47
cultures that have histories of
11:54
natural disasters earthquakes hurricane things of that sort that have
12:01
histories of terrible pandemics that have histories of high population
12:07
density with food shortages cultures with the history of this up to
12:14
400 years ago are cultures that are more militaristic
12:20
now when you look at traditional human populations they basically come in
12:26
three different types they're farmers their hunter-gatherers who hunt animals
12:32
and just pick up wild foods to eat or they are pastoralists people who wander
12:39
the desert with their camels or with their reindeer or their cows and all of
12:44
that something you see is if you were a hunter-gatherer bad people cannot come
12:51
at night and feel your rainforest if you're a farmer people cannot come at
12:58
night and feel all of your crops if you're a pastorless people can come
13:04
at night and fuel your cows and steal your camels and what you see is
13:10
pastoralist cultures are much much more violent than those from the other two
13:16
groups and in Africa in my work there
13:21
for 30 years the tribe nears to me are Maasai Messiah are pastoralists they're
13:27
cow people and the tribe on the other side of the Border raids them about once
13:33
a year when there's a full moon and steals cows from them and they go have a battle where 10 people are dead
13:39
afterward with your Spears and you don't see this in traditional Farmers or
13:45
traditional hunter-gatherers so different types of ecosystems produce
13:51
different types of cultures and yes some cultures are much more militaristic than
13:56
others these cultures of pasture lists they're the only ones that believe you
14:03
will go to heaven if you die in battle they're the only ones that take 13 year
14:10
olds and for the next 10 years they need to be in their military and be a warrior
14:15
they're the only ones where men will have four or five wives this is the
14:22
Middle Eastern pastoralists Shepherds and such so yeah different cultures have very
14:28
different levels of it that's looking at humans over the last 10 000 years
14:34
looking at humans from the last 400 years cultures where people have been
14:40
treated very badly by life um tend to be more aggressive and more
14:46
easily propagandized because the leaders there have much more
14:52
of an incentive to say those are the people you should hate they're the ones
14:58
who are the cause of your problems not me not us not us we're in charge
15:07
all the same parts of the brain involved and do we behave alike when a monkey
15:12
kills another monkey and when a man sitting in his room pushes a button and
15:18
someone in Afghanistan dies absolutely and Studies have been done
15:24
where people are sitting there watching their favorite football team and you're
15:30
taking blood from them measuring stress hormone levels or they're in a brain scanner and it is if they are in the
15:36
middle of it themselves it is the same parts of the brain only if you were
15:42
somebody who would kill for your football team you are such a great fan
15:48
of them if you know if you're not that interested it doesn't happen much a wonderful finding in the United States
15:55
uh spousal abuse when men beat their wives
16:01
um you look at men who are very very uh they committed football fans and in
16:09
the afternoon and evening after their home team loses the rate of beating of
16:14
wives goes up and the beating of children it's a football team and
16:21
the body is one and the same in those circumstances and again no chimpanzee
16:27
could do that and we can sit there and hear an abstraction about something far
16:34
away in space for far away in time and we're smart enough to fool our brains
16:40
into thinking it's as real as a chimp biting into our leg this sounds terrible but that from our
16:48
modern perspective when a monkey kills another one or when ancient people do so
16:54
from the outside it looks like there is more stress more aggression there but
16:59
when a man is sitting in a room and like you said simply pushes a button it looks
17:05
like a routine job it is hard to make myself believe this brain is boiling
17:10
like the brain of the early people or monkeys yes because our brains are
17:16
sophisticated enough to mistake a book for reality or a movie
17:22
for reality or Imagining the enemy of your state that you were doing in by
17:28
pushing your button and such but admit that picture I mean we've got the same wiring of aggression as any other
17:35
species out there because of the complexities when you look at the wiring the amygdala and a human is exactly like
17:43
in a baboon in a chimpanzee in a rat but because of this cognitive ability we are
17:50
the most violent and the most aggressive and the most damaging species on Earth where does aggression come from in
17:58
people anyway can you paint us a picture of what is happening in our body when we
18:04
are angry with somebody well I think the most interesting thing about the neurobiology of aggression is that when
18:12
you look at the part of the brain that is most centrally involved in aggression it's a
18:18
brain region called the amygdala and when you look at the part of the brain that is most involved in fear is
18:25
also the amygdala and I think what this tells us is you cannot understand the
18:31
biology of aggression without understanding the biology of organisms that are afraid that are subordinate
18:39
that are anxious that are frustrated I think aggression is completely tied into
18:46
that what is this the amygdala you have dedicated lectures to it what does it
18:54
look like where is it how did they prove it was the amygdala responsible for
18:59
human aggression the amygdala is a very ancient part of
19:05
the brain basically every mammal out there has an amygdala and it works very
19:11
similarly in all of them it's part of what is called the limbic system which is a part of the brain very involved in
19:18
Emotion but what the amygdala does is learn
19:23
it learns what to be afraid of it learns who you don't like
19:29
it learns who is threatening it learns all of those things in the same way that
19:36
another part of the brain will learn a mathematical equation for you the
19:41
amygdala learns about frightening things and it learns about aggressive things and it's not very accurate at it it's
19:49
very very fast but it's not very accurate and as a
19:54
result you have amygdala driven aggression that makes mistakes a lot of
20:01
the time um there's a few very very rare human diseases where the amygdala is damaged
20:08
and only the amygdala and these are people who are pathologically truthful
20:17
you cannot make them change their behavior with negative reinforcement
20:23
they they play an economic game with somebody else where there's a certain
20:28
degree of cooperation or competition and the usual profile you see is the
20:34
person you were playing against does something untrustworthy and miserable to you and what you do then is you decrease
20:42
your cooperation and there's all sorts of mathematical relationships with this take somebody without an amygdala and
20:50
the other player is robbing them of everything and they don't change their
20:55
play they don't change their level of cooperation the part of the brain that's
21:00
saying that was awful what that person just did and I'm going to shift my
21:05
behavior appropriately towards being less Cooperative or maybe even towards being aggressive it doesn't respond you
21:14
don't see that in them so all of those types of information collectively
21:19
teaches you about the amygdala and there's English scientific journals now
21:25
there's a journal called amygdala and all it does is publish research about the amygdala thousands and thousands of
21:33
studies that have been done on this function other cases that prove that a person had
21:38
a larger amygdala and was more aggressive at the same time great example of that is not so much
21:46
aggression but fear again linking the two of them
21:51
um I'm not sure if this is a diagnosis in Russia post-traumatic stress disorder
21:57
you have people coming back from the military from a sexual assault from some
22:03
sort of thing and about 15 to 20 percent of them develop post-traumatic stress
22:09
disorder you cannot sleep you cannot you see threat everywhere and it destroys
22:16
people's lives saying you you still have American veterans from the Vietnam war
22:22
in the 1960s whose lives were completely crippled by post-traumatic stress
22:28
disorder and a very interesting thing is when you look at people with PTSD on a brain
22:34
scanner the amygdala gets bigger and it becomes more reactive and a face
22:40
that any of us would say is neutral somebody like that says that's a
22:46
threatening face that face is menacing me and the amygdala activates when somebody else's would not and if you
22:53
show something a face that is actually threatening everybody is amygdala activate and two minutes later everybody
23:00
else's amygdala has gone quiet post-traumatic stress disorder an hour
23:06
later it is still activated and some of the work that I've done is looking at
23:11
how that happens it turns out there's a class of hormones that are secreted
23:16
during stress and what do they do they make neurons in the amygdala grow new connections and
23:24
new circuits and the amygdala gets bigger and it's the stress of combat of
23:32
trauma of some such thing it does that and that's exactly the case where you see somebody with an enlarged amygdala
23:39
where they see threat that nobody else does and they see aggression as a
23:46
solution to threat that most people don't see and that amygdala getting that lightning fast reflexive information is
23:54
all set up to make a mistake and before you know it you think the guy who just
23:59
happens to look in a certain way the guy is holding the cell phone is actually holding a handgun instead and you pull
24:06
that trigger how did they figure out and prove that the problem was exactly with the make
24:12
the life that it was a magdala involved in it were there any tumors or something
24:19
what did the scientific experiment look like when it was first found out yep if
24:25
you were a neuroscientist the greatest thing on earth is a war because you wind
24:30
up getting soldiers coming back with different types of head injuries and in the 19th century the first things we
24:38
started learning about different parts of the brain came from people coming back from war with injury
24:45
um the much more modern versions now whether you were looking at a human or a
24:50
monkey or a rat if you use a brain scanner and you see what part of the
24:56
brain activates During certain behaviors emotional state you put an electrodes
25:02
and you see aha when we give a scary face to look at no neurons and the
25:08
amygdala suddenly get more active or you put in a different type of electrode and
25:14
you stimulate it and suddenly there's nothing provocative around but the
25:20
animal becomes aggressive do I get it right they'll raise a gene
25:25
for aggression
25:31
have they looked for it yes and you know
25:37
this is the era of people being very excited about genes and genetics you can
25:46
sequence the human genome all of that and out of that comes
25:51
this belief that genes control everything genes control your cells your
25:58
organs your body your behavior all of that and genes are stupid
26:05
genes have no idea what they're doing saying that a gene
26:11
decides when it activates is like saying a recipe for a cake
26:17
decides when you were going to make the cake all teams are is the instruction book
26:24
and environment comes along and activates this team returns that Gene
26:31
off or things of that sort genes are just the code so for starters they don't
26:38
control anything they're just a recipe book an environment controls them
26:44
amid that is there any single Gene involved in aggression and people have
26:52
believed this is the case forever and they come up with the gene that explains
26:58
aggression and the gene that explains sexual orientation and DJing
27:04
sufficiently so that there's this one gene that lawyers have used in a
27:09
courtroom to get a murderer have a shorter jail sentence because he has this violent
27:16
Gene so he couldn't control it or there is essentially no behavior in
27:23
humans that is caused by a single Gene and as a measure of how complicated it
27:29
is um when people now could look at the entire Genome of people and look at
27:36
every single Gene in there and humans have about 20 000 of them let's ask the most
27:45
boring thing you can ask about a human how tall are they what do genes have to
27:52
do with height and what they've identified so far is more than 800 different genes that help
28:00
to explain height in humans and all of those genes put together
28:05
explained 13 of the variability
28:10
so that's what's going on with height just imagine since then they have done
28:15
one for obesity and I think the last time I saw that they were up to a thousand genes on that
28:22
one just imagine what teams have to do with how easy it is to convince you that you
28:29
should be afraid of those people wow they're a gene for that how easy is it to figure out the
28:37
genetics of you could look at somebody who looks completely different from you
28:42
but if they are in pain you will feel that that's going to be 5 000 genes
28:49
involved in doing that genes very interesting
28:55
um it is very easy for people to get excited about them and to decide that
29:01
they are more powerful than they actually are yes I think I hear about a
29:06
case when geneticists said that there is a gene for aggression and thus if your
29:11
mother was a maniac you need to be viewed as you might commit a similar number of crimes is there anything like
29:19
that yes that's exactly an example where
29:24
there's hundreds and hundreds of genes involved and suppose even
29:30
there was a gene for aggression there is not one but Suppose there was one gene
29:36
for aggression oh my God somebody has the version of that Gene that makes them
29:41
aggressive that is going to give you no ability to
29:47
predict is this someone who is going to go out and kill 10 people
29:52
or is this someone who when they are playing chess they're really aggressive
29:58
in their chess play that's not going to have anything to do with genes that's going to be culture
30:04
where their parents parents loving where they abused as a child were they all the
30:09
things having nothing to do with that or as another example rather than genes a
30:15
part of the brain that keeps you from doing behavior that is
30:21
socially inappropriate it's called The frontal cortex front when you feel like
30:27
telling somebody you think their hair do you look ridiculous and you stop
30:33
yourself because that would not be nice it's because you're a frontal cortex when any any other example like that
30:39
and in the United States at least 25 of the men in prison
30:47
who are going to be executed for their murders that we still do that here but
30:52
25 of the men on what is called death row have a history of concussive damage
30:59
to their frontal cortex and when that is damaged you were not looking at somebody
31:05
with a bad Soul you were looking at a car whose brakes do not work well very
31:11
anymore okay so that's what the frontal cortex does but you sit there and I've
31:19
had this experience of like working with the defense in a
31:24
murder trial of somebody with frontal damage and you're telling the jury he's got a
31:32
terrible frontal damage he can't control his behavior this is not an evil person this is a neurological problem all of
31:39
that and when the prosecutor then gets to ask me questions and it's meant to be
31:46
very hostile they will say Okay okay so if you saw someone who had damage to the
31:52
frontal cortex and 20 of their cortex was destroyed can you tell us this is
31:59
someone who's going to be a murderer and the answer is absolutely not for the
32:05
same amount of damage this person is going to be a murderer and that person
32:10
at parties laughs too loud and stays too long and doesn't notice that everybody
32:17
else wants to go to sleep oh my God destroy the frontal cortex and this is
32:22
someone who like at a funeral will talk too loud oh my God they're out of
32:29
control that's not neurons and that's not genetics that's were they raised with a
32:36
stable family did their parents love them when they had their injury did were
32:41
they taken care of or were they living on the streets afterward and yeah so the
32:47
same amount of damage some people become murderers some people laugh too loud in
32:53
Social circumstances for the same gene or much more realistically for the same
32:59
800 genes someone's going to become a murderer and
33:04
somebody else is going to play chess
33:09
very aggressively and the difference between those two have nothing to do
33:15
with genes that's all culture and experience interestingly a parallel that the
33:22
hormone that everybody thinks of with aggression is testosterone and male
33:28
secreting testosterone and what everybody thinks is testosterone makes you aggressive it doesn't do that
33:36
testosterone makes aggressive individuals more aggressive and it makes
33:41
you more aggressive to the individuals you were already aggressive too like a
33:47
wonderful example of this you take five monkeys males and they form a dominant
33:53
hierarchy number one number five all of them you look number one can beat up two
34:00
three four five number two computer two foot five four you take number three and
34:05
you give them huge amounts of testosterone does he get into more aggression now absolutely yes does it
34:13
mean that he is suddenly challenging number two and number one
34:18
not at all he never goes near them all he's doing is being a nightmare to
34:25
numbers four and five he's aggressing them ten times as much testosterone is
34:31
not causing aggression it's increasing the volume of the aggression that was
34:37
already there learned socially so the problem isn't testosterone the
34:43
problem is society's rewarding certain types of aggression how do I get
34:50
you right people like maniacs or serial killers is there exclusively a social
34:56
reason for it and they have nothing different the neurons are not working differently do they do so because they
35:03
like to kill and are calm while doing it social environment
35:09
is influencing their behavior by changing their brains it's not social environment causes
35:17
Behavior or your brain causes Behavior social environment changes the brain by
35:24
the time and this is a classic one um in cultural anthropology you look at
35:32
cultures that are called collectivist cultures everybody works together everybody
35:38
farmed together and everybody out there it is always people from China
35:44
Japan East Asia and it has a lot to do with rice farming because you need an
35:51
entire Village to do that then you have individualistic cultures and the United
35:56
States is the most extreme version of that and what you see is within 10
36:02
minutes of birth mothers from collectivist cultures when
36:07
they are singing to their baby they sing more softly than mothers from
36:12
individualistic cultures you're 10 minutes old and already your
36:20
brain is being shaped by what culture you got stuck into
36:26
individualistic versus Collective culture influences how long a baby cries
36:32
before a mother Picks Them Up on the average at what age does a baby sleep
36:37
alone in a room all of that every step of that from the time you were 10 minutes old
36:44
already your brain is being constructed by the values of your culture so it's
36:51
impossible to separate them there is a study that just came out
36:57
showing fetuses third trimester fetuses with there's now
37:03
fancy enough brain Imaging techniques that you could look at the brain of a fetus and while they are still in the
37:11
mother's womb the wealth of the parents the socioeconomic status of the parents with
37:19
already a predictor of how fast the brain was growing if you had poor
37:24
parents already on the average the brain was growing more slowly you're not even
37:29
born yet and social factors like
37:35
like are you wondering if you are going to be thrown out in the street the end
37:41
of this month because you cannot pay your rent raises stress hormone levels in the mother which gets into a fetus
37:48
and the fetal brain and before you're even born that's already beginning to
37:54
influence how your brain is constructed so it's not choose a one or the other they are exactly the same
38:01
over the last two years the number of Home violence cases have risen in Russia
38:07
they were 2 682 women killed in Russia over the last
38:12
two years by their spouses and there have been over 12 000 women killed over
38:19
the last eight years do you think there will be a rise in domestic violence now
38:24
after the war when soldiers start coming back home now because they have got used
38:30
to violence is there any social data on that experiments
38:35
absolutely because they have just spent time being told
38:41
that violence is not only okay it's a good thing
38:46
because they usually come back broken by trauma broken by the things
38:54
they have seen and had to do uh because they often come back and
39:01
realize they were lied to when they were sent off to kill and to die and this was
39:09
for nothing and this was for lies and it breaks people in many different
39:16
ways whether it's violence against children your wives
39:22
whatever if it's depression if it's alcohol
39:28
um I think these are circumstances where people come back broken and they have been used
39:35
as tools and they've been taught that aggression
39:40
is part of their uh orchestration of things that they
39:48
have available for them to do so I think there's absolutely an increase
39:55
that's how things are I understand there must be some drugs some antidepressants
40:00
something that can calm them have they tried removing their amygdala altogether
40:06
to make people calm not angry not willing to make Wars the Dogma here at
40:13
least among Psychiatry is that nobody is cured of post-traumatic stress disorder
40:19
what do you learn how to do is keep it under control so it doesn't ruin your life it just ruins every time you go to
40:26
sleep and your mind is rushing with it um one of the things my laboratory did uh
40:35
we were exploring a technique of gene therapy within the brain taking genes
40:40
from sticking them in in different brain regions and changing function and one of the things we did with sticking a gene
40:47
that breaks down these stress hormones and when you do that the stress hormones
40:54
no longer cause nickel which would expand no longer cause that response this was not in humans this was in Lab
41:00
Rats so maybe techniques like that there's some very sophisticated
41:06
psychological techniques that are being used now that may help with that uh
41:12
you know we're not very good at it right now hopefully we will get better have
41:17
such experiments being done on people too difficult uh I've been working in
41:22
that area for 30 years and every year we say this is wonderful what we're finding
41:29
out with rats and soon we'll be able to test it in humans and it's going to be fabulous and 30 years later
41:37
brain is a hard thing to manipulate especially if you're like have a big
41:44
thick skull and like you don't like grab
41:49
someone and hold them down and drill a hole in their head and see what you can do there
41:55
human gene therapy by now you know it's practically children in elementary
42:01
school can do gene therapy on diseases of the liver of the kidneys it's
42:07
incredibly easy the brain the brain is 20 years behind every other
42:12
part of the body when it comes to new science
42:21
[Music]
42:45
two three and while I was doing it I I didn't feel any regret I didn't feel
42:52
any uh uh guilt it was only after afterwards
42:58
when I began to reflect on what I had done that this began to this Behavior began to dawn on me and I
43:04
realized that this was uh uh this was a part of me and I hadn't
43:10
really noticed before Stanford's Prison Experiment I can help asking you about it since you've been
43:16
working at Stanford University for a long time and you must have known it from the inside when some people were
43:22
playing the roles of the inmates and the others of the waters and the experiment
43:27
had to be stopped earlier than it was planned and later it was found out that
43:32
the scientists behind the experiment was pushing people to aggression but how was
43:38
it in reality that's exactly the case um it it happened in the building next
43:44
door to mine when I was first coming to Sanford trying to get a job there I was
43:49
going through that building it looks so fun this was the prison this
43:55
is where they did the prison experiment it's it's a part of the the mythology of
44:01
the university the man who ran the experiment um a psychologist named Philip zimbardo
44:07
who he's in his 80s now he's a friend he took me under his wings
44:12
but he he is a very charismatic
44:19
strong personality and he played the role of the warden the person in charge
44:26
of the prison and everybody the the guard for just reading all of the cues from him that he
44:33
wanted to see chaos and since then there was a very good study in England that
44:40
was done where they repeated the Stanford Prison uh set up but they had a
44:47
completely different structure of authority amongst the uh the guards and
44:52
what happened there is the prisoners organized that overthrew the guard and
44:57
formed a collective totally different outcome than so that's one of the
45:03
problems the Stanford everybody knows about the Stanford Prison study and almost no one knows that confound
45:12
um a similar experiment that was carried out in the 1960s by a psychologist named
45:18
Stanley Milgram um where he told people okay this person in the Next Room you're
45:25
looking at them through a glass they have wires to them and if they give the
45:31
wrong answer to a question you need to give them a shock and you need to make it if they have two
45:38
in a row make the stock A Little Bit Stronger three in a row make the shop a little bit stronger and the finding that
45:45
everybody learns in every textbook is 70 of people you're willing to do it we're
45:53
willing to follow this command and the person in the Next Room was an actor the
45:58
person was trained at the shocks they would freak eventually they fell over they clutched their chest all of that
46:04
like great drama excellent
46:10
I gotta keep getting a shock if you don't answer the next one is rich
46:17
330 volts oh my God 70 of people were following
46:26
orders they would have marched off and rounded up people for the concentration camps all of that what people now
46:34
realize is the majority of those people knew that this was this was staged this
46:40
was just acting and at the time everybody learned oh my God all of the
46:47
guards in the Stanford Prison Experiment became Savages and three-quarters of
46:53
people will follow orders to shock an innocent person to the point where they fall over and yes exactly as you said
47:01
this is not the reality of those very interestingly Stanley Milgram whose
47:08
parents survived Hitler Stanley Milgram and zimbardo who did the Stanford
47:14
experiment they were friends together in high school are you saying that
47:21
I don't know how that happened but yes they they knew each other in high school and the two of them did the two most
47:28
disturbing experiments suggesting like anybody could be a Nazi
47:34
and what the studies really showed was that was not the case
47:40
a Serbian artist did an experiment in the 90s when she laid out different
47:46
tools you might know they were ropes and I've gone and she sat to the museum
47:52
visitors they could do whatever they wanted to her body and they did and at
47:57
every step with every visitor they were getting more and more aggressive was it
48:02
something like I'm playing a computer game I'm not really killing I'm participating in an experiment or is it
48:09
something different I think it is both I think the popularity of video games a
48:16
whole generation growing up you know where where violence like that
48:22
seems completely normal I think it is reflecting a pull a biological pull
48:28
towards aggression in some people and when it feels like it is just a game it
48:34
becomes even more so amid that so there's a literature like every single
48:40
stage when television began to have violent programs on it everyone said oh
48:46
my God it's going to make children sociopaths they're all going to grow up being violent and when movies began to
48:53
do more violence it's the same oh my God and now video games and all of that and what the study show is
49:01
violent media violent movies violent video games they make children who are
49:08
already aggressive more aggressive they do nothing to the other children all
49:15
they do is take the children who already have a tendency towards aggression and
49:21
say it's allowed and it doesn't even count and look they're doing it too what
49:29
you see with a lot of things with that can you then say that events in butra or
49:34
Urban is a Stanford experiment being carried out in real life
49:40
my guess is it was not every Russian soldier
49:46
it was a small subset of them and what the studies
49:52
during the Vietnam war American soldiers who committed atrocities against
49:58
Vietnamese it was a tiny percentage of the troops like one percent of the
50:05
troops accounted for 90 percent of the atrocities that sort of thing so I think
50:10
that's exactly the case where somebody who is a monster already
50:16
this is a circumstance that says wonderful go for it I think
50:22
it says very little about Russians it said very little about Americans in
50:28
Vietnam it said very little any of these cases but it says something about
50:34
the thickest and most damaging Among Us those are
50:40
exactly circumstances that say these are enemies they hardly even count
50:46
kill the civilians rape the women they don't even count as us and they are
50:52
threatening to destroy your Homeland no yes
51:01
I'm still trying to prove this for the Stanford scientists not sure how it is
51:07
in the States but in Russia if a person holds more or less important position that gives power say an old lady at a
51:15
reception somewhere they tend to be more aggressive right away how is it
51:21
connected doesn't it prove that if a person is given the slightest power he gets more
51:28
aggressive enormously [Music]
51:38
I can't help asking you the person who has spent so much time with monkeys in
51:44
movies they often show us a war between people and monkeys fantasy like that do
51:50
you think Evolution might have gone differently and only one species could have survived
51:56
well separate of the fact that I do not think this would ever happen
52:02
um species are driven into extinction by other species that hunt them
52:10
um not go to war with them um they hunt them and that is very
52:17
rarely the case because by definition if this species is killing so many of them
52:23
for food that there's not that many of them left this species is going to starve
52:28
and one of the principles in ecology is predator species do not control the
52:35
number of prey species prey species control the number of predators in that direction
52:41
so the only times you would see a species driving another one into Extinction
52:49
from their behavior itself it's usually from hunting um and even that is very rare
52:57
um what what did humans do to the Neanderthals
53:02
no one is ever going to know what is clear though is a lot of humans and a
53:07
lot of Neanderthals made it uh four percent of the DNA and Europeans is
53:13
neanderthal and it's Origins so like it's easy to come up with a
53:22
scenario that humans killed the Neanderthals into Extinction
53:28
they out-competed them for food nobody knows
53:34
um but I think the notion of one species driving another one into Extinction
53:40
is a very very rare unlikely possibility
53:45
um despite what you see in movies how did people overcome cannibalism
53:51
of course there are rare cases a group of people who were stuck all winter in
53:58
the snow in the mountains an airplane crash and they're where you see
54:04
cannibalism but it turns out when you look at the anthropological literature
54:10
the cannibalism that we all think of oh you kill your enemies and eat them and that sort of thing there's almost no
54:17
cases of that what that turns out to almost always be the case is somebody
54:22
telling the Anthropologist the people up River do you know what they do they eat
54:29
they're dead can you believe that and when you investigate it it is not really the case about the only example of what
54:37
would be called EXO cannibalism eating somebody from outside your group was the
54:43
Aztec empire in Mexico because they had a shortage of animal protein and they
54:48
built a whole culture around killing of enemy captives and things like that
54:54
what is much more interesting is cases of endo cannibalism cannibalism within a
55:02
group and you see this in New Guinea among Headhunters among uh Forest
55:11
Warriors way up in the rainforest there and you see endocannibalism what does
55:17
that look like your mother dies in old age and what you do is you cook her and
55:23
the entire Village comes and the way you are like a loving child to her is you
55:31
have this endocannibalistic ceremony and that's very rare that's one of the only
55:37
cultures that have been found to do that but that one is much better documented than any cases of oh my God those people
55:45
living there they eat people they eat you if they capture you among these New
55:51
Guinea Highlanders this endocannibalism is like an established part of their
55:57
religion it was the case up until around the 1970s 1980s and it's almost gone by
56:05
now and because of missionaries because of the government putting on pressure
56:10
and you go and you talk to elderly people there and they say these kids
56:17
these days this is terrible when I die who is going to cook me and serve me
56:24
it's it's cultural change all these kids are interested in is is hamburgers and
56:31
things of that sort um there's a fascinating neurological disease called Kuru which was only found
56:40
in this one tribe in the New Guinea Highlands and it started with one individual they
56:47
think about 200 years ago and it's an infectious particle that winds up in the
56:53
brain which would be consumed in one of these ceremonies and passed on
56:59
to the next generation and consumed and passed on and that was a whole new type
57:04
of neurological disease built around that there's there's no other example of that disease anywhere in the world but
57:11
when you look at sort of the storybook versions of cannibalism it's mostly One
57:17
Tribe trying to make another tribe sound like a bunch of savages animals killing animals of the same kind
57:24
say a monkey kills a monkey does it then eat it or do they only eat other species
57:32
basically not um you see that in some species like
57:37
hyenas and even them you don't see much of it no that's
57:43
uh all sorts of social species out there avoid incest mating with a close
57:50
relative uh all sorts of species tend to avoid cannibalism of their own group and
57:57
such that seems to be very widespread among animal species so that is rare
58:02
everywhere you look exceptions are in some cases some rodent species
58:10
where you have a male and a female with pups and the male is driven out by
58:17
another male who comes in what he will do at that point is kill all the pups
58:22
belonging to the previous male and what he will often do is eat them at that point
58:28
um you see in some species pigs for example if
58:33
you're a mama pig and you've just given birth to 10 piglets and one of them is
58:41
very weak and one of them is a lot smaller and that one is not going to survive the mother will kill and eat
58:48
that one that often happens but as defeating your enemy in battle and then
58:56
you eat them afterward very very little of that in the animal world
59:02
is that because they understand it's a relative because there is no neural
59:08
circuit that would tell them to eat one of their own kinds and it could be one or the other
59:16
um the other possibility is it may not taste good um may get your stomach upset in
59:23
literally there is reason to think that one of the reasons why humans survive to species
59:31
we're weak we're slow we're like every animal out there could kill us is it
59:37
happens that human muscle has a lot of acid in it lactic acid that's just our
59:43
metabolism and human meat doesn't taste very good to lions and tigers and such
59:49
so they've got to be really desperate before they're willing to eat some disgusting human and maybe that's why we
59:57
survived as a species so it could be some sort of psychological state it
1:00:03
could be a biological neurobiological it could be something like
1:00:08
your stomach does not have the enzymes to break it down and every time you eat one of those you're sick afterwards so
1:00:16
I'm not going to eat them how do I get it right that agriculture has changed
1:00:21
our aggressiveness from the point of view of evolution yes yes um
1:00:27
there is a whole school of anthropologists who say humans have been
1:00:34
violent humans have had Warfare all the way back to when humans and chimps split
1:00:40
off it's five million six million years old and that is like in our genes that's
1:00:46
in our DNA um when you look at things closely Warfare was not invented until humans
1:00:54
invented agriculture what agriculture does it's a much more efficient way of
1:00:59
creating food than Hunter Gathering um you can get Surplus you can get more
1:01:06
Surplus than you need and as soon as you have Surplus you've got unequal division of surplus you have
1:01:14
class you've got hierarchy hunter gatherers do not go to war against other
1:01:20
hunter-gatherers because everybody has a valley and everybody has the same plants and everybody has the same animals and
1:01:26
all of that and as soon as you invent material culture with agriculture
1:01:32
suddenly there's haves and have-nots and suddenly you want their territory and
1:01:39
you want their Surplus and suddenly you have hierarchy and you have Kings and
1:01:46
leaders and such suppressing those below when you look at the archaeological and
1:01:52
the paleontological evidence there's plenty of evidence of one person killing another person I think the oldest
1:01:59
evidence now for that is twenty thousand years ago or so um but it's not until agriculture that
1:02:07
people began to organize themselves into armies that would go against each other
1:02:12
you know it's obviously a silly way to State it but I think inventing
1:02:19
agriculture was the worst mistake humans ever made um it was a terrible mistake it was a
1:02:27
you you invent famines you invent drought you invent Warfare you invent
1:02:33
all of that it seems agriculture was invented humans started getting shorter
1:02:39
and living shorter all the way for these thousands of years until around the 19th
1:02:44
century that's how bad agriculture so agriculture was this terrible stupid invention because among other things it
1:02:51
invented Warfare so yeah it's absolutely right this is a fairly recent human invention modern
1:02:58
humans spent 90 of their history without Warfare the original title of this
1:03:05
session was everything you know is wrong and I'm going to present evidence that this particular part of our common
1:03:10
understanding is wrong that in fact our ancestors were far more violent than we are that violence has been in Decline
1:03:17
for long stretches of time and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species existence
1:03:26
I don't know if you know Stephen Pinker is an American scientist who specializes
1:03:31
in the field of experimental psychology he published a book called the best in us where he proves that we have become
1:03:39
kinda better and more would you challenge his opinion is
1:03:48
he is a brilliant man I know him a little bit
1:03:53
he is a very good speaker and writer um so it is hard to take him on but he
1:04:01
is one of the strongest Believers in the notion that humans have had Warfare
1:04:09
for five million years and he reports the literature he picks this
1:04:17
study picks that study instead of looking it's a whole literature and such his whole argument has been humans have
1:04:24
been miserable and horrible and violent for five million years until the
1:04:30
Enlightenment and western civilization what I think instead is human
1:04:36
hunter-gatherers for five million years had no Warfare and it wasn't until agriculture
1:04:41
and then something happens in the enlightenment so we differ with that the
1:04:46
question is what happens in the enlightenment and his view is controversial
1:04:52
because it's saying oh thank God if this is a more peaceful
1:04:59
planet now than it was 500 years ago it's because of white Christian culture
1:05:05
and the enlightenment which ignores a lot of the planet also when he argues that the world since
1:05:15
the second world war has become more peaceful and he argues that very strongly what he
1:05:22
is arguing is Europe and white people have become more peaceful
1:05:27
and what the U.S and the Soviet Union figured out how to do is have somebody else fight their Wars there was one
1:05:35
period when I was spending time in Africa where Ethiopia and Somalia were
1:05:41
at war with each other and Somalia was Marxist and getting Soviet weapons and
1:05:48
Ethiopia was hitting American weapons and then there was a coup and governments were overthrown and suddenly
1:05:55
it was Ethiopia that was Marxist getting Soviet presence and Somali that was the best friend of the United States
1:06:02
so one reason why Europe has become more peaceful is we figured out how to have
1:06:07
other people fight our Wars for it which is a pretty recent invention
1:06:13
um where I think he is right is the average person
1:06:20
has become more peaceful in the sense that in the United States
1:06:27
200 years ago the average person would have said slavery is okay it is okay for
1:06:35
six-year-old children to work in factories and be worked to death
1:06:41
is it it is okay if somebody wants to beat their horse to death because the
1:06:46
horse is pulling their Carriage slowly and something has changed so that now 99
1:06:52
of people think that it's terrible individual
1:06:58
levels of empathy and kindness and things like that have absolutely gotten
1:07:06
better over these last 200 years and you look at some of the things that were invented the United Nations the
1:07:14
Geneva Convention the Red Cross The Doctors Without Borders all of these
1:07:19
were invented in the last half century or so things have gotten better in that regard
1:07:26
the ways in which they have not is you get somebody who is violent now and
1:07:33
instead of taking a club and heating and innocent person over the head in their
1:07:40
medieval village they now have an automatic weapon where they can shoot 30
1:07:46
people in 10 seconds or instead of having your army invade
1:07:51
the neighbors with your cavalry you now relieve poison gas on that
1:07:58
because the iran-iraqi war so I think the Tinker is right that the average
1:08:04
person has become more peaceful and more empathic
1:08:09
and some of it has to do with European culture hooray for that but not all not
1:08:15
all of it but at the same time the people who are evil and damaging Now can
1:08:22
do so much more damage then the evil damaging people in the
1:08:28
past I mean what Hitler did was
1:08:33
you know in the 1920s this man Henry Ford in the United States figured out
1:08:39
how to automate how to make the construction of an automobile completely
1:08:45
automatic in a factory and just you could produce 40 of them a day and a person working there was like
1:08:53
a cog in a machine just doing their thing over and over every 10 seconds they had to turn both on the next one
1:08:59
and what Hitler did was turn killing humans into a factory operation also
1:09:06
um that was very 20th century and that is what the worst of us can do
1:09:12
now at the same time we've got the exact same wiring as any other animal out
1:09:19
there built around empathy and social affiliation and it's exactly the same
1:09:26
except we can be empathic to somebody on the other side of the planet and send
1:09:31
money to them or we can sit and read about how the volcanic explosion and in
1:09:39
Pompeii 2000 years ago seeing people who died Sheltering their child and you see
1:09:46
the cast of it and you can feel their pain 2 000 years later or again you can
1:09:52
read a book and your heart breaks over a character we are smart enough that we are capable
1:10:01
of being the most violent horrible species on Earth and the most altruistic and in both
1:10:08
cases we are able to do it in ways that no other animal can understand
1:10:15
do you think tolerance is a natural state of a human or is it rather a
1:10:20
made-up cultural norm I'm definitely of the opinion that most of the interesting
1:10:26
things about humans were not invented by humans and you can see precedent for it
1:10:34
uh other primate species um I'm not very impressed with how much
1:10:40
human culture has invented wonderful things okay
1:10:45
talking about animals and their tolerance what is it like tolerance in
1:10:51
animals not people technology yeah a great one would be
1:10:59
basically you look at a troop of baboons which is what I've spent 30 years
1:11:06
studying and tolerance consists of a new young male will join a group and does
1:11:16
everybody beat up on him the next day does everybody take out their
1:11:21
frustrations on him is he allowed to sit among everyone is he allowed to groom
1:11:26
with other individuals and different baboon troops have very different levels
1:11:32
of Tolerance wherein some troops a new individual it will take 70 days before
1:11:39
anyone will interact with them and other troops that take three days
1:11:44
um so not just humans who can show tolerance but also tremendous variation
1:11:51
from one group of humans or a babbons to another as a biologist would you say the
1:11:58
fittest survived or the friendliest the thinking about Darwin
1:12:03
um not Darwin himself but people who misinterpreted Darwin the idea that
1:12:11
animals behave for the good of their own species and the idea that what evolution
1:12:17
is about is survival of the fittest and in the 1960s what swept through was
1:12:26
a recognition both from animal behavior and from genetics animals don't behave
1:12:32
for the good of the species they behave to leave copies of their own genes in
1:12:38
the Next Generation or genes of their close relatives to do the same and it's not survival from the
1:12:45
standpoint of evolution you can live to be 500 years old and if you don't pass
1:12:51
on the copies of your genes you are invisible to Evolution so this passing on copies of change and it's doing it
1:13:00
for the good of you and individuals who share your dreams and it's reproduction
1:13:05
rather than mere survival so as soon as people sort of figured
1:13:11
that out it broadened this era that does everything about evolution is about
1:13:17
aggression and competition and winning and being high ranking and leaving more
1:13:24
copies of your genes and that was the next mistake that dominated the field
1:13:29
for the next 30 Years and what we know by now is there are as
1:13:35
many evolutionary models to start cooperation as there is to start
1:13:40
aggression when you look at various species when you look at
1:13:47
bonobo companies and you look at the genetics of which males were passing on
1:13:53
their genes it's not the most aggressive ones it's the one who the females like and go and meet with them this whole
1:14:00
Revolution that evolution is not about competition and aggression
1:14:07
it's about competition and aggression in some settings and cooperation and
1:14:13
altruism and other things interestingly the first person who sort of thought
1:14:19
through that was Prince Peter krapokkin in 1906 he was 60 years ahead of the
1:14:27
whole literature in a book that he published saying evolution is driven by
1:14:33
cooperation not by violence and now here's some crazy Bolshevik let's
1:14:40
pay no attention to him and he was 60 years ahead of every other evolutionary
1:14:46
biologist what we now know is sometimes cooperation helps sometimes aggression
1:14:52
helps and the best thing you want to be is very smart at knowing when to do this
1:14:58
and when to do that and not confuse the two cocky you think in the future there is a possibility of a war with a
1:15:05
different species say with robots no I think humans will always be much too
1:15:11
busy having Wars with each other um I think we can count on that with
1:15:18
unfortunately a lot of confidence thank you so much Robert
