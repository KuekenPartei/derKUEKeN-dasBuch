0:05
in the 17th century when galileo discovered that the earth turned around the sun rather than the other way around
0:11
many people were in a state of great shock they had thus far believed that humans
0:16
were at the center of the cosmos and around this idea they had built their whole belief system
0:22
suddenly this did not seem to be the case anymore the theology
0:28
can be clarified by pointing out that in relation to culture he takes a sort of galileo type standpoint
0:36
since the time of galileo people have thought that when it came to culture in society humans were at the center
1:02
if one realizes that the rules according to which mankind behaves for the largest part were already invented long before
1:08
one was born and the name of the inventor remains completely unknown to us
1:16
galileo but from another perspective one can also compare chomsky to galileo
1:21
because his work in the science of language linguistics has had a great revolutionary influence over the whole
1:28
world chomsky has brought about a major transformation in the field of
1:33
linguistics interestingly chomsky's theories point in the exact opposite direction as the
1:38
theories of foucault gives much more primacy to the subject
1:48
of confrontation between these two completely different thinkers it is moreover good to remember that they work
1:54
in very different fields
2:00
chomsky is a language researcher in other words foucault's interest lies in the history of scientific language while
2:07
chomsky's interest lies in the daily language we use
2:13
this is interesting and maybe also not coincidental that the debate between these two thinkers only really gets
2:19
exciting in the second half when they start discussing politics
2:25
i believe it is good that this is preceded by a theoretical part
2:30
this is because in any discussion about philosophy and society what matters are not the political standpoint certain
2:36
thinkers happen to take but rather on the basis of which arguments they do so
2:47
it might be nice to know that this discussion took place in the auditorium of the technical college of eindhoven
2:55
discussion between two philosophers two researchers whose work is characterized by great precision
3:02
great detail and also great clarity further i thought it quite symbolic that
3:08
it took place in a space with lots of glass the inner and outer world blended
3:13
together during the broadcast you could see the traffic outside passing by
3:19
symbolic indeed because the relationship between the inner and outer world is central to the first half of the fourth
3:25
philosopher's debate about human nature and the ideal society [Applause]
3:38
ladies and gentlemen welcome at the fourth debate of the international philosophers project
3:46
tonight's debaters are mr michel foucault the college de france
3:52
and mr norm chomsky of the massachusetts institute of technology
4:00
both philosophers have points in common endpoints of difference
4:05
perhaps the best way to compare those philosophers is to look at them as mountain diggers
4:12
working at the opposite sides of the same mountains with different tools
4:18
without knowing even if they are working in each other's direction
4:23
all learning concerning men ranging from history to linguistics and
4:29
psychology are faced with the question whether in the last instance
4:34
we are the product of all kinds of external factors or if in spite of our differences
4:41
we have something we could call a common human nature by which we can call each other human
4:47
beings so my first question is to mr chomsky because you mr chomsky employ often the
4:54
concept of human nature and even in this connection you are using terms like innate ideas and innate
5:00
structures which arguments can you derive from linguistics in order
5:06
to give such a central position to this notion of human nation
5:13
well let me begin in a slightly technical way
5:19
a person who's interested in studying language is faced with the with a very definite empirical problem
5:27
he's faced with an organism a mature let's say adult speaker
5:33
who has somehow acquired an amazing range of abilities
5:39
which enable him in particular to say what he means to understand what
5:44
people say to him to do this in a in a fashion that i think it's proper to call highly creative
5:51
now the person who's acquired this intricate and highly articulated and organized uh
5:58
collection of abilities the collection of abilities that we call knowing a language that person
6:04
has been exposed to a certain experience he has been presented in in the course of his lifetime with a certain amount of
6:12
of data uh of info of direct experience with the language and we can investigate the data that's
6:18
available to this person and having done so in principle we're faced with a very
6:24
clear and a reasonably clear and and well delineated scientific problem
6:30
namely the problem of accounting for the gap between the really quite small
6:37
quantity of data small and rather degenerate quantity of data that's presented to the person to the child
6:43
and the very highly articulated highly systematic uh profoundly organized
6:49
uh resulting knowledge that he somehow derives from this data furthermore even more remarkable we
6:56
notice that in a wide range of languages in fact all that have been studied seriously
7:02
there are remarkable limitations on the kinds of system that emerge from the very
7:08
different kinds of experience to which people are exposed well this
7:14
there's only one possible explanation for in a in a one one container rather schematic fashion
7:20
uh for this uh remarkable phenomenon namely the
7:25
assumption that the individual himself uh contributes
7:31
uh a good deal an overwhelming part in fact of the general schematic structure and
7:38
perhaps even of the specific content of the knowledge that he ultimately
7:43
derives from this very scattered and limited experience that is to put it rather loosely
7:49
the child must begin with the knowledge certainly not with the knowledge that he's hearing english or dutch or french
7:55
or something else but he does start with the knowledge that he's hearing a human language of a
8:00
very narrow and explicit type that permits a very small range of variation and it's because he begins with that
8:07
highly organized and very restrictive schematism that he's able to make the huge leap from
8:14
scattered and degenerate data to highly organized knowledge and i would claim then that
8:21
this instinctive knowledge if you like this schematism that makes it possible to
8:27
derive complex and intricate knowledge on the basis of very partial data is one fundamental constituent of human
8:33
nature but then i assume that in other domains of human intelligence and other domains of
8:39
human cognition and even behavior uh something of the same sort must be true well the collection of this
8:46
uh mass of innate scheme uh schematisms uh innate
8:51
organ organizing principles uh which guides our social and intellectual uh
8:58
and individual behavior that's what i mean referred to by the concept of human nature
9:04
well mr foucault if i'm thinking at your books like eastward de la fully
9:11
shows i got the impression that you are working on a completely different
9:18
level and also just visit opposite aim opposite goal
9:23
if i am thinking about the word schematism in relation to human nation then you are just trying to work out
9:29
that there are several periods several schematisms what do you think about this
9:36
well if you permit i will answer in french because my english is so bad that i would be ashamed to
9:44
answer in english
9:50
it is true that i mistrust the notion of human nature a little and for the following reason
10:01
i believe that the concepts or notions that a science can use
10:09
not all have the same degree of elaboration
10:18
let's take the example of biology within the field of biology there are concepts that are more or less well
10:24
established like the concept of a
10:31
but reflex also exists peripheral notions which do not play an organizing role within science
10:41
they are not instruments of analysis and they are not descriptive either
10:51
these notions simply serve to point out some problems or rather to point out
10:57
certain fields in need of study
11:08
a very important concept in the field of biology
11:18
in the 17th and 18th centuries the notion of life was hardly used when studying nature
11:28
classified natural beings whether living or non-living in a vast hierarchical
11:33
tableau life was a concept they didn't use and
11:38
didn't need at the end of the 18th century a number
11:44
of problems arose for instance in relation to the internal
11:50
organization of these natural beings
12:04
that had been unclear in the past and could not have been perceived until then suddenly came
12:09
[Music]
12:15
in chemistry have also highlighted certain problems in relation to the connections between chemical reactions
12:21
and the physiological processes of organisms
12:27
and that's how an entire field appeared one that was completely new for biologists one that is nowadays known as
12:34
life life was a concept that served to point
12:40
out new fields of study that science still had to discover
12:47
i would say as a historian of science that the concept of life was an epistemological indicator
12:55
an index of the problems that still had to be uncovered and i asked myself whether perhaps one could say the same
13:01
thing about human nature is therefore comparing chomsky's concept
13:08
of human nature with the concept of life as used in biology and in the history of
13:13
that science he does this because he sees the concept of human nature more as an indication of
13:21
a research program rather than as an indication of humanity's potential for achievement for him
13:27
human nature acts as a scientific shopping list and nothing more
13:36
as long as it is clear that the fields of biology physiology and neurology still don't have the means to adequately
13:42
describe human nature and humans capacity for language
13:51
the moderator mr elders finds it difficult to keep the interaction flowing between the two speakers
13:59
this is partly due to the different languages they speak importantly due to the fact that chomsky
14:05
and foucault inhabit such different worlds of thought to the point in which their ideas easily
14:12
slide past each other we actually observe the curious phenomenon of two brains thinking
14:17
simultaneously
14:23
in order to further elucidate it from his own system of
14:29
that thought chomsky the concept of creativity plays an important role and the following part of the debate will be
14:35
largely dedicated to this issue for chomsky creativity is actually a characteristic of all human beings
14:42
everybody uses it people stuck in traffic who unexpectedly and on the spot have to think about what to do next
14:51
the educator who doesn't want to fall into a pattern of authoritarian behavior and when confronted with a difficult
14:57
pupil has to invent new behavior but above all this creativity applies to
15:02
the child who learns a language and who curiously learns to produce new languages
15:16
she constantly emphasizes the so-called epistemological field in which human
15:21
activity takes place of this epistemological field or
15:27
episteme is described as the totality of unconscious rules that manage the
15:32
totality of all separated fields of knowledge
15:41
and also calls it system of elements and in the debate the word grill is
15:46
mentioned bar or grid perhaps it's best to speak of a network
15:52
within which everybody in a particular culture thinks whether they want it or not
15:58
it is a certain set of rules to which everybody's thinking obeys and with which people search for identity
16:04
coherency and so forth and the network the system is not a creation of particular individuals it
16:11
decides the rules of the think and do habits we call culture
16:16
which every individual is subjected to such a system is not a thing or idea but
16:22
lies precisely in between these days
16:31
the history of thought is not to be associated with the history of ideas or even the development of the mind
16:37
but rather it should be understood as discontinuous transformations transitioning from one network to
16:43
another network that is a totally different approach from that of chomsky for whom
16:49
creativity plays a central role
16:56
at this point we encounter foco's dethroning the subject as already illustrated with the example of galileo
17:12
one could say that paradoxically it is a philosophy without philosophers an idea
17:18
to be generalized because humans are according to foucault greatly absent within their own culture
17:24
in this respect foucault's strong and negative reaction towards the moderator who showed interest in private matters
17:30
of his life
17:45
this is an introduction to the following quite detailed theoretical part of the debate which seems to mainly focus on one
17:52
question to what extent is the individual able to discover something new and if so how
17:59
should we make sense of this this seems to me a very relevant question
18:06
especially if we remind ourselves that we need quite some new forms of behavior knowledge and science if we want to
18:12
survive together in this world
18:19
we resume the debate where foco explains why he doesn't pay much attention to the creativity of the individual from a
18:26
historical perspective
18:34
within the traditional history of science the creativity of individuals has been
18:40
accorded maximum importance the history of science up until recently
18:47
essentially consisted of showing how an individual whether it was newton or mendel
18:55
had been the creator or rather the discoverer of a reality that was already existing
19:01
in things and in the world
19:08
a reality that no other person had previously discovered
19:13
i believe the postulate that lies at the core of the traditional history of science
19:19
is that truth exists in order to be known yet the human mind
19:24
due to the effect of a number of inhibitions or obstacles has not managed to see this truth
19:36
the mind is made to see the truth and a contingent obstacle is impeding him to see it
19:45
according to some historians this obstacle could be linked to socioeconomic conditions
19:51
or to different forms of mentality or to a belief and naivety in the old
19:56
religious myths and moral themes all of these could act as obstacles as blinders to those who want to see the
20:03
truth reality the mind is meant to see
20:08
it is made to have access to the truth
20:13
in this traditional conception of the history of science on the one hand there is an emphasis on
20:19
the creativity of the individual who has the right to possess the truth
20:25
and yet a system of obstacles will prevent him from capturing formulating and constructing this truth
20:32
to which he is essentially entitled to possess
20:44
i believe the problem that is being posed is the exact opposite what happens when we witness a great
20:50
scientific transformation
20:55
in the great scientific transformation for instance the birth of biology mid 17th century or the birth of philology
21:02
at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century
21:08
it is true that a number of obstacles prejudices preconceived ideas tumble and disappear
21:17
what strikes me however is that science at the moment of its birth not only gets rid of certain number of obstacles
21:25
but also eliminates and masks a certain amount of existing knowledge
21:32
it's as if applying a new grid which allows for the appearance of phenomena that had been previously masked
21:40
while at the same time masking already existing knowledge
21:48
therefore a science the advancement of science and the acquisition of science is not simply the oblivion of old
21:55
prejudices or the fall of certain obstacles
22:02
it is a new grid that masks certain things while allowing for the appearance of new knowledge therefore when i
22:08
criticize the notion of creativity what i mean is that truth is not acquired through a kind of continuous
22:15
and cumulative creation but rather through a set of grids stacked on top of one another which leak old and collect
22:22
new knowledge i think in part we're slightly talking in cross purposes because
22:28
of a different use of the term creativity in fact i should say that my use of the term creativity is
22:34
a little bit idiosyncratic and uh therefore the onus falls on me not on you in this case but when i speak
22:41
of creativity i'm not uh attributing to the concept
22:46
the uh notion of value that is normal when we speak of
22:52
creativity that is when you speak of scientific creativity you're speaking properly of
22:58
the achievements of a newton but in the context in which i've been speaking about creativity
23:04
it's a normal human event i'm speaking of the kind of creativity that any
23:10
child demonstrates when he is able to
23:16
come to grips with a new situation uh describe it properly react to it
23:22
properly tell us something about it uh you think about it in a new fashion for him
23:27
and so on these are i think it's appropriate to call those creative acts
23:33
but of course without thinking of those acts as being the acts of a newton it's the
23:38
lower levels of creativity that i've been speaking of now as far as what you say about the history of science is
23:44
concerned i think that's correct and illuminating and particularly relevant in fact to the kinds of
23:50
enterprise that i see uh lying before us in psychology and linguistics and the
23:57
philosophy of mind that is i think there are certain topics that have been
24:02
what was your word depressed or put aside during the uh
24:07
scientific advances of the say past two centuries century ahead but now i think we can uh
24:14
overcome those it's possible to put aside those limitations and forgettings
24:19
and to bring into our consideration precisely the topics that animated a good deal of the thinking and
24:25
speculation of the 17th and 18th century and to incorporate it within a much
24:30
broader and i think deeper uh science of man that will give
24:37
fuller role though certainly not hope that will not hope to give complete
24:43
understanding uh to such notions as innovation and creativity and
24:49
uh freedom and uh uh production of new
24:56
uh entity new elements of thought and behavior within some system of rule and schematism those are concepts that i
25:02
think we can come to grips with in reality i believe there is a quite
25:08
strong similarity between what mr chomsky said and what i have tried to show in other words
25:14
there exist in fact only possible creations possible innovations
25:21
one can only in terms of language or of knowledge produce something new by putting into play a certain number of
25:28
rules which will define the acceptability or grammaticality of these statements
25:34
or which will define in the case of knowledge the scientific character of the statements
25:47
we can roughly say that linguists before mr chomsky mainly insisted on the rules
25:52
of construction of statements unless on the innovation represented by every new
25:57
statement or the hearing of a new statement
26:05
and in the history of science or in the history of thought we placed more emphasis on individual creation
26:13
and we had kept aside and left in the shadows these communal
26:19
general rules which obscurely manifest themselves through every scientific discovery
26:25
every scientific invention and even every philosophical innovation
26:36
these are not only linguistic rules but also epistemological rules which characterize contemporary knowledge
26:43
perhaps i can try to react to those comments within my own framework in a way which
26:48
maybe will shed some light on this how is it that we're able to construct any kind of scientific theory at all
26:56
how is it that given a small amount of data it's possible for various scientists for
27:01
various geniuses even over a long period of time to arrive at some kind of a theory at least in some cases that is
27:08
more or less profound and more or less empirically adequate this is a remarkable fact
27:13
and in fact if it were not the case that these scientists including the geniuses
27:19
had if they didn't have built into their minds somehow obviously unconscious
27:25
specification of what is a possible scientific theory then this inductive leap would certainly be quite impossible
27:32
just as if each child did not have in built into his mind the concept of human language
27:38
in a very natural way in a very narrowing way then the inductive leap from data to knowledge of a language
27:43
would be impossible so even though the process of let's say deriving
27:48
knowledge of physics from data is far more complex far more difficult for us for for organisms such as us
27:56
far more drawn out in time requires intervention of genius and so on and so forth nevertheless in a certain sense it
28:02
rel the achievement of discovering physical science or biology or whatever you like is based
28:10
on something rather similar to the achievement of the normal child in discovering the structure of his language that is it must be achieved on
28:17
the basis of an initial limitation an initial restriction on the class of possible theories
28:23
and the fact that science converges and progresses that itself shows us that such
28:28
initial limitations and structures exist that is i don't think that scientific progress is simply a matter of
28:35
accumulative addition of new knowledge and uh
28:40
absorption of new theories and so on rather i think it has this sort of jagged uh pattern that you described for getting
28:46
certain problems and leaping to new theories and so on and so forth and transforming the same knowledge
28:52
but i think that the explanation for that so i think one can perhaps hazard an explanation for that fact
28:59
and oversimplifying grossly i really don't mean what i'm not going to say literally
29:04
it's as if as human beings a particular biologically given organism
29:09
we have in our heads to start with a certain set of possible intellectual
29:14
structures possible sciences okay now in the lucky event that some aspect
29:21
of reality happens to have the character of one of these structures in our mind
29:26
then we have a science so and it's because of this it's because of this limitation initial limitation in our
29:33
minds to a certain kind of possible science it's precisely that that provides the
29:38
tremendous richness and creativity of scientific knowledge that is if it were not it's important to stress that this has to do with your
29:45
point about limitation and freedom if it were not for these limitations we would not have the creative act of going from
29:53
a little bit of knowledge a little bit of experience to a rich and highly articulated and complicated array of
29:59
knowledge it's precisely because of that that the progress of science i think has the uh erratic
30:06
and jagged and transformational character that you describe and that doesn't mean that everything is
30:11
ultimately going to fall within the domain of science quite the contrary personally i believe that
30:17
many of the things we would like to understand and maybe the things we would most like to understand such as
30:23
the nature of man or the nature of a decent society or lots of other things might really fall be outside the scope
30:29
of possible human sciences well i think we have now two uh two questions out of this statement
30:36
one question is if you can agree mr foucault do you agree with this statement about a combination of
30:43
limitation fundamentally combination it's not a matter of combination
30:49
creativity only becomes possible thanks to a system of rules
30:55
it's not a mixture of order and freedom freedom can only be exercised thanks to
31:02
a system of regularity
31:08
where perhaps i don't completely agree with mr chomsky is when he places these regularities
31:14
within the sphere of the human mind or human nature
31:21
i would like to know whether one cannot discover the system of regularity and of constraint which makes science possible
31:27
somewhere else even outside the human mind
31:34
in social forms in relations of production in class struggles etc
31:43
but what does this theory of knowledge mean for your theme of the death of man or the end of the period of the 19th and
31:49
20th centuries but this is not related to what we are
31:55
talking about i don't know because i was trying to apply what you have said in relation to
32:02
your anthropological concept
32:10
you've already refused to speak about your own creativity and freedom haven't you well i'm wondering what are the
32:16
psychological reasons for this you can wonder about it but i can't help
32:22
that but what are the objective reasons in relation to your perception of
32:28
understanding of knowledge of science for refusing to answer these personal
32:33
questions does it have to do with your conception
32:39
of society when there is a problem for you to
32:45
answer what are your reasons for making a problem out of a personal question
32:51
no i'm not making a problem out of a personal question i make a personal question an absence of a problem
33:00
in the entire tradition of the history of thought ideas and sciences
33:05
one has always questioned the problem of knowing at what age was newton weaned into
33:10
conceiving the universal law of gravity at what period did cuvier meet his first
33:17
mistress in order to finally discover fossils and comparative anatomy etc
33:25
i believe these types of analyses which i'm now simplifying are not very interesting
33:32
on the other hand it is much more interesting to understand the transformation of a certain knowledge within the general field of science and
33:39
within the so-called vertical field
33:45
which consists of a society a culture a civilization at a particular moment in
33:50
time once we finally grasp the totality of this transformation we realize that the
33:56
little individual moments of a wise man's life are not important
34:03
again foucault's last comment suggests how the individual life of the researcher tends to disappear from sight
34:10
but how do we explain then the relation of man in relation to its culture in politics and maybe even the question
34:17
about how to change this culture and society after all one can show within the
34:22
history of science and culture the input of the individual is almost negligible
34:29
the question how do i act the political question
34:42
rapidly develops into how far can mankind escape from its own culture
34:51
it's important to note that foucault doesn't want to distance himself from politics
35:00
he says i would have to be ideologically blind to not interest myself for that which is most substantial to human
35:06
existence economic relations power relations you name it therefore chomsky and foucault do agree
35:14
on the importance of the political question in his opinion it is required to abolish
35:20
and destroy the different forms of capitalism in order to favor direct workers participation
35:28
it may also be informative to explicitly mention that chomsky defines his political standpoint as
35:33
anarcho-syndicalism in workers councils and so on and so forth
35:39
decentralization socialization and participation are key words in chomsky's
35:44
political program chomsky might say he sees no obvious
35:50
relation between his scientific and political views but the following opening statement reveals that he had
35:56
straight from his scientific conceptions to politics
36:02
his political and scientific views may not flow logically one from the other they do certainly head in the same
36:08
direction well let me begin by referring something that i've already discussed that is if
36:14
it is correct as i believe it is that a fundamental element of human nature
36:19
is the need for uh creative work for creative inquiry for
36:28
for free creation uh without the arbitrary limiting effects of coercive
36:35
institutions then of course it will follow that a decent society
36:41
should maximize the possibilities for this fundamental human characteristic to be
36:47
realized that means trying to overcome the uh elements of repression
36:54
and oppression and destruction and coercion that exist in any existing society ours for
37:02
example as a historical residue not a federated
37:08
decentralized uh system of free associations
37:14
incorporating economic as well as social institutions would be what i refer to as anarcho-syndicalism
37:21
and it seems to me that it is the appropriate uh form of social organization
37:26
for an advanced technological society in which human beings do not have to be
37:31
forced into position of tools of cogs in the machine in which the creative urge the
37:38
uh that i think is intrinsic to human nature will in fact be able to realize itself in whatever way it will i don't
37:43
know all the ways in which it will i would say that i'm much less advanced than mr chomsky in this respect
37:54
that is i admit not being able to define not even to propose an ideal social model
38:00
for the functioning of our scientific or technological society
38:09
scientific technology on the other hand one of the tasks that
38:16
seems immediate and urgent to me over and above anything else is this
38:26
it is the custom at least in our european society to consider that power is localized in
38:32
the hands of government and that it is exercised through a
38:37
certain number of particular institutions such as the administration
38:44
the police or the army one knows that all these institutions are made to
38:50
transmit and apply orders and to punish those who don't obey
38:57
me but i believe that political power also exercises itself
39:03
through the mediation of a certain number of institutions that look as if they have nothing in common with
39:08
political power and as if they are independent from it
39:25
and more generally all teaching systems which appear to disseminate knowledge
39:35
are made to maintain a certain social class in power
39:51
another example is psychiatry which in appearance is also intended for the good of humanity and for the knowledge of
39:58
psychiatrists but in reality is another way to bring to bear the political power
40:04
over a social class justice is yet again another example
40:12
it seems to me that the real political task in our contemporary society is to criticize the workings of institutions
40:20
particularly the ones that appear to be neutral and independent and to attack them in such a way that
40:26
the political violence which has always exercised itself obscurely through them
40:32
will finally be unmasked so that one can fight against them
40:37
if we seek to advance straightaway a profile or a formula of the future of society without having thoroughly
40:43
criticized relations between the different forms of political violence that exercise their power within our
40:49
society we run the risk of letting them be
40:56
reproduced even in the case of the noble and apparently pure forms such as antarcto
41:02
syndicalism i would certainly agree with that not only in theory but also in action that
41:08
is there are two intellectual tasks one
41:14
and the one which i was discussing to try to create the vision of a future just society
41:21
another task is to understand very clearly the nature of power and oppression and
41:27
terror and destruction in our own society and that certainly includes the institutions you mentioned
41:33
as well as the central institutions of any industrial society
41:38
namely the the economic commercial and financial institutions in particular
41:45
in the coming period the great multinational corporations which are not very far from us physically tonight
41:52
those are the basic institutions of uh oppression and coercion and autocratic
41:59
rule that appear to be neutral after all they say well we're subject to the democracy of the marketplace
42:05
still i think it would be a great shame to lose or to put aside entirely
42:12
the somewhat more abstract and philosophical if you like task of trying to draw the connections between
42:20
a concept of human nature that gives full scope to
42:25
freedom and dignity and creativity and other fundamental human characteristics
42:31
uh and relates that to uh some notion of social structure in which
42:37
those properties could be realized in which meaningful human life could take place
42:42
and in fact if we are thinking of social transformation or social revolution though it would be absurd of course to
42:48
try to draw out in detail the point that we're hoping to reach still we should
42:54
know something about where we think we're going and such a theory may hell to us
43:00
yes but then isn't there a danger here if you say that a certain human nature
43:06
exists that this human nature has not been given the rights and possibilities that allow it to realize itself in our
43:13
contemporary society
43:19
that's really what you have said i believe and if one admits this doesn't one risk
43:25
defining this human nature which is at the same time ideal and real
43:31
and has been hidden and repressed until now in terms borrowed from our society
43:38
from our civilization from our culture i will give an example by greatly
43:45
simplifying it marxism at the end of the 19th century
43:51
and the beginning of the 20th century admitted that in capitalist societies
43:56
man hadn't reached its full potential for development and self-realization
44:06
that human nature was effectively alienated in the capitalist system
44:12
and marxism ultimately dreamed of a liberated human nature
44:20
on the other hand what model did it use to conceive project and eventually realize that
44:26
human nature it was in fact the bourgeois model
44:34
marxism considered that a happy society was a society that gave room for example
44:42
to a sexuality of a bourgeois type to a family of a bourgeois type
44:53
and it is moreover very true that this has happened in the soviet union a kind
44:58
of society simultaneously real and utopic had been reconstituted and
45:04
transposed from the bourgeois society of the 19th century in which humans finally
45:09
were able to realize their true nature the result that you also realized i think
45:15
is that it is difficult to conceive of what human nature precisely is
45:21
isn't there a risk that we will be led into error mao zedong spoke of bourgeois human
45:27
nature and proletarian human nature and he considers that they are not the same thing
45:32
well you see i think that in the intellectual domain of political action
45:38
that is the domain of trying to construct a vision of a just and free society on
45:44
the basis of some notion of human nature in that domain we face the very same problem that we face
45:50
in immediate political action for example to be quite concrete
45:56
a lot of my own activity really has to do with the vietnam war and a good deal of my own energy goes into civil disobedience
46:02
well civil disobedience uh in the united states uh is an action undertaken
46:10
uh in the face of great uns of considerable uncertainties about its effects
46:15
uh for example it threatens the social order in ways which let's say might one might argue bring on
46:21
fascism that would be very bad for the for america for vietnam for holland and for everyone else
46:27
so there's a danger that is one danger in undertaking this concrete act on the other hand there's a great danger
46:33
in not undertaking it namely if you don't undertake it uh the society of indus indochina will
46:39
be torn to shreds by american power and in the face of those uncertainties one
46:44
has to choose a course of action well similarly in the intellectual domain uh one is faced with the uncertainties
46:51
that you correctly pose our concept of human nature is certainly limited partial socially conditioned
46:58
constrained by our own character defects and the defects and the limitations of the
47:05
intellectual culture in which we exist yet at the same time it's of critical importance that we have some
47:12
some direction that we know uh what impossible goals we're trying to
47:17
achieve if we hope to achieve some of the possible goals and that means that we have to be bold
47:24
enough to speculate and create
47:29
social theories on the basis of partial knowledge while remaining very open
47:34
to the uh strong possibility in fact overwhelming probability that at least in some
47:40
respects we're very far off the mark well perhaps it is interesting to um
47:47
to go on a little bit further on this problem of strategy so for example in the case of holland
47:54
we had something like population census you were obliged to
48:00
fill in your papers and so on you know so this you would call if you are not
48:05
filling in your paper civil disobedience right now i i would be a little careful about that because
48:11
uh uh going back to some very important point that mr foucault made one does not necessarily allow the state
48:19
to define what is legal the state has the power to enforce a certain concept of what is legal but
48:25
power doesn't imply justice or correctness even so the state may define something as civil disobedience and may
48:32
be wrong in doing so for example in the united states the state defines it as civil
48:38
disobedience to let's say derail an ammunition train that's going to vietnam and the state is
48:44
wrong in defining that as civil disobedience because it's legal and proper and should be done
48:50
it's proper to carry out actions that will prevent the criminal acts of the state just as it's proper to
48:56
violate a traffic ordinance in order to prevent the murder if i was standing at a street corner and the traffic light
49:01
were red let's say i was standing in my car and i drove across the traffic light to prevent somebody from
49:08
let's say machine gunning a group of people of course that's not violation of law it's an appropriate and proper
49:13
action no sane judge would convict you for such an action similarly a good deal of what the state
49:19
authorities define as civil disobedience is not really civil disobedience in fact
49:24
it's legal in fact obligatory behavior in violation of the commands of the state which may or may not be legal
49:31
commands so one has to be rather careful about the about calling things illegal i think
49:37
yes but i would like to ask you a question
49:43
when in the united states you commit an illegal act which i regard as illegal not just the state no
49:51
the the states when the state considers it illegal
49:57
do you justify your action in terms of justice of an ideal
50:05
or do you justify it in terms of necessary class struggles
50:16
very often when i do something which the state regards is illegal i regard it as legal yes because i regard the state as
50:22
criminal but in some instances that's not true that is let me be quite concrete about
50:28
it uh and move from the area of class war to imperialist war where the situation is
50:34
somewhat clearer and easier take international law a very weak instrument as we know but
50:40
nevertheless it incorporates some rather interesting principles well international law in many respects is
50:46
the instrument of the powerful that is international law permits
50:52
much too wide a range of inter of international forceful intervention in support of
50:58
existing power structures that define themselves as states and against the interests of masses of
51:04
people who happen to be organized in opposition to states but in fact international law is not solely
51:11
of that kind and in fact there are interesting elements of international law let's say embedded in the united nations charter
51:17
which permit in fact i believe require the citizen to act against his own state
51:23
in ways that the state will falsely regard as criminal but nevertheless he's acting legally because international law
51:30
also happens to to prohibit the threat or use of force in
51:35
international affairs except under some very narrow circumstances of which for example the war in vietnam is not one
51:41
which means that in the particular case of let's say the vietnam war the one that interests me most
51:46
the american state is acting in a criminal capacity and people have the right to stop criminals from from
51:52
murdering people uh just because the criminal happens to call you to call your action illegal when you try
51:58
to stop him that doesn't mean it is illegal i mean a perfectly clear case of that is the present case of the pentagon
52:04
papers in the united states which i suppose you know about reduced to its essentials and forgetting
52:10
legalism what is happening is that the state is trying to prosecute people for exposing its crimes
52:16
that's what it amounts to so it is in the name of a purer justice
52:22
that you criticize the functioning of justice
52:30
it is important for me to know about this
52:35
in france there is currently a debate about the problem of justice and that of popular judicial institutions
52:54
believe that in order to make a critique of the current penal system or of police practices
53:03
we have to create a kind of tribunal which in the name of a superior ideal
53:11
and human justice will condemn the practices of the french judges or policemen
53:24
moreover there is another group of people myself included who say this shouldn't be done because
53:31
when they refer to an ideal justice which the tribunal is supposed to apply
53:37
they refer to a certain number of judicial ideas which were formed in our time by a
53:45
certain number of individuals who are themselves directly or indirectly
53:51
a product of their societies
54:06
we have to attack the police and their practices but in terms of war and not in terms of
54:14
justice i believe that your role in the war is a just role that you're fighting a just war to bring
54:21
in a concept from another domain and that i think has to is is important if you thought that you were fighting an
54:27
unjust war you couldn't follow that line of reasoning and the only see i would like to slightly
54:32
reformulate what you said it doesn't seem to me that the differences between legality and ideal justice
54:39
it's rather between legality and better justice now this better system may have its
54:44
defects certainly will but comparing the better system with the
54:49
existing system and not being confused into thinking that our better system is the ideal
54:55
system we can then argue i think as follows that the concept of legality and the concept of justice are not identical
55:03
they're not entirely distinct either insofar as legality
55:09
incorporates justice in this notion in this sense of better justice referring to a better
55:14
society then we're ju then we should follow and obey the law and force the state to obey the
55:21
law and force the great corporations to obey the law and force the police to obey the law if we have the power to do so of course
55:28
if but not inst just finally if in those areas where the legal system
55:34
happens to represent not better justice but rather the techniques
55:40
of oppression that have been codified in a particular autocratic system well then
55:45
a reasonable human being should disregard and oppose them at least in principle he may not for some reason do
55:50
it in fact i would simply like to reply to your first sentence
55:57
when you said that if you didn't consider the war you wage against the police to be just you wouldn't wage it
56:04
i would like to reply to you in terms of spinoza and tell you that the proletariat doesn't wage war against the
56:10
ruling class because it considers such a war to be just
56:17
the proletariat wages war against the ruling class because it wants for the first time in history to take power and
56:24
because of its will to overthrow power it considers such a war to be just yeah
56:30
i don't agree one wages war to win not because it's just i don't personally agree with that for example if i could
56:36
convince myself that attainment of power by the proletariat would lead to a
56:42
terroristic police state in which uh freedom and uh dignity and
56:50
decent human relations would be destroyed then i wouldn't want the proletariat to take power
56:56
in fact the only reason for wanting any such thing i believe is because one thinks
57:02
rightly or wrongly that some fundamental human values will be achieved by that transfer of power
57:10
hello
57:17
when the proletariat takes power it may be quite possible that the proletariat will exert towards the classes over
57:23
which it is just triumphed a violent dictatorial and even bloody power
57:35
i can't see what objection one could make to this
57:42
but if you ask me what would be the case if the proletariat exerted bloody tyrannical and unjust power towards
57:50
itself then i would say that this could only occur if the proletariat hadn't really
57:57
taken power but that a class outside the proletariat
58:02
a group of people inside the proletariat a bureaucracy or petite bourgeois
58:07
elements had taken power well i'm not at all satisfied with that
58:12
theory of revolution for a lot of reasons historical and other but even if one were to accept it for
58:18
the sake of argument still that theory uh is holding that is maintaining
58:24
that it is proper for the proletariat to take power and exercise it in a violent and bloody and unjust fashion
58:31
because it is claimed in my opinion falsely that that will be
58:36
that that will lead to a more just society in which the state will wither away in which the proletariat will be a
58:43
universal class and so on and so forth if it weren't for that further justification the
58:48
concept the concept of a dictatorship of proletariat violent and bloody would certainly be unjust at
58:54
least i i for example am not a committed pacifist that is i don't say i would not hold
59:00
that it is under all imaginable circumstances wrong to use violence
59:05
even though use of violence is in some sense unjust i believe that one has to estimate relative injustices
59:12
but the use of violence and the creation of some degree of injustice can
59:20
only itself be justified on the basis of the claim and the assessment which always ought to
59:26
be undertaken very very seriously and with a good deal of skepticism that this violence is being exercised because
59:33
a more just result is going to be achieved uh if it does not have that grounding
59:39
it really is totally immoral in my opinion as far as the aim of the proletariat in
59:45
leading a class struggle is concerned
59:53
i don't think it would be sufficient to say that it is in itself a greater justice
1:00:02
what the proletariat will achieve by expelling the ruling class and by taking power
1:00:08
is precisely the suppression of class power in general
1:00:17
that is the further justification that is the justification but one doesn't speak in terms of justice but in terms of power
1:00:23
it's because the end that will be achieved it is claimed as a just end if the
1:00:28
[Music] no you know leninist or whatever you like would dare to say we have a right to take
1:00:35
power let's say we the proletariat and then throw everyone else into crematoria
1:00:42
let's say i mean if that were the consequence of the proletariat taking power of course it would not be appropriate the idea is and the as for
1:00:50
reasons i mentioned i'm skeptical about it that uh a period of violent dictatorship of
1:00:55
perhaps violent and bloody dictatorship is justified because that will mean the submergence and termination of classroom
1:01:02
of class oppression a a proper end to achieve in human life
1:01:08
but it seems to me that in any case the notion of justice itself functions within a society of classes
1:01:15
as a claim and as a justification for it made by the oppressed class justification
1:01:26
and in a classless society i'm not sure that we would still use
1:01:33
this notion of justice i well here i really disagree i think that
1:01:39
there is a sort of an absolute basis uh if you press me too hard i'll be in trouble because i can't sketch it out
1:01:45
but some sort of an absolute basis ultimately residing in fundamental human qualities
1:01:52
in terms of which a real notion of justice is grounded and i think that our existing systems of
1:01:59
justice can i think it's too hasty to characterize our existing systems of
1:02:05
justice as merely systems of class oppression i don't think that they are that i think
1:02:10
that they're that they embody systems of class oppression and they embody elements of other kinds of oppression
1:02:17
but they also embody a kind of a groping towards the uh true
1:02:22
human humanly valuable concept of justice and decency
1:02:28
and love and kindness and sympathy and so on which i think are real well do i have time to answer
1:02:36
yes how much because two minutes
1:02:42
but i would say that that is unjust absolutely
1:02:55
i will simply say that i can't help but to think that the concepts of human nature
1:03:04
of kindness of justice of human essence and its actualization
1:03:11
all of these are notions and concepts that have been created within our civilization our knowledge system and
1:03:17
our form of philosophy and that as a result they form part of
1:03:25
our class system and one can't however regrettable it may
1:03:31
be put forward these concepts to describe or justify a fight which should
1:03:36
and shall in principle overthrow the very fundaments of our society
1:03:47
this is an extrapolation for which i can't find the historical justification
1:03:54
well um i think we can start immediately the
1:03:59
discussion and uh
1:04:04
mr chomsky i would ask you one question in your discussion you
1:04:10
had the vocabulary a proletariat we as proletarian it's the the irony of
1:04:16
history that at the moment young intellectuals coming from middle class and upper class call themselves
1:04:22
proletarians and say we must join the proletarians but i don't see any class
1:04:28
uh conscious proletarians that's a great dilemma uh it is not true in our given society
1:04:36
that all people are doing useful productive work or self-satisfying work obviously
1:04:41
it's very far from true those people lots of people who are excluded from
1:04:47
uh the possibility of productive labor and i think the rev the revolution if you want should be in the name of all
1:04:53
human beings but it will be have to be conducted by certain
1:04:58
categories of human beings and those will be the i think the human beings who really are involved in the productive
1:05:03
work of society now what that is will differ depending on the society in our society it i think includes
1:05:11
intellectual workers so i think that the student revolutionaries if you like have a
1:05:17
they have a point a partial point that is it's a very important thing in a more in a modern advanced industrial
1:05:23
society it's very important how the trained intelligentsia identify themselves uh if they're going to be
1:05:31
technocrats let's say or servants of either the state or private power or alternatively whether they're
1:05:37
going to identify themselves as part of the workforce who happen to be doing intellectual labor if the latter then they
1:05:44
play they can and should play a decent role in a progressive social revolution
1:05:49
if the former then they're part of the class of the oppressors
1:05:55
i have an additional uh one small additional question or more remark to you
1:06:00
that is that you wish you were very courageous attitude towards the war in vietnam how can you survive in an
1:06:08
institution like mit which is known here as one of the great war contractors and
1:06:14
intellectual makers of this war there are two aspects to that one is the
1:06:19
question how i'm how mit tolerates me and the other question is how i tolerate mit
1:06:25
well as to how mit tolerates me here again i think one shouldn't be overly schematic
1:06:34
it's true that mit is a major institution of war research
1:06:39
but it's also true that it embodies very important libertarian values
1:06:45
which are i think quite deeply embedded in american society fortunately for the world
1:06:52
they're not deeply embedded enough to save the vietnamese but they're deeply enough embedded to
1:06:58
prevent far worse worse disasters and here i think one has to be a bit qualified that is
1:07:04
there is imperial terror and aggression there is exploitation there is racism
1:07:10
lots of things like that but there's also a real concern coexisting with it
1:07:16
for individual rights of assert which for example are embodied in the bill of rights which is by no
1:07:22
means simply an expression of class oppression it is also an expression of the necessity to defend the in the
1:07:28
individual against state power now these things coexist you know it's
1:07:34
not that simple it's not just all bad or all good and uh it's because it's the particular
1:07:39
balance in which they coexist that makes it that makes an institute that
1:07:44
produces weapons of war be willing to tolerate uh in fact you know in many ways even encouraged to be quite honest a person
1:07:51
who's involved in civil disobedience against the war now as to how i tolerate mit that raises another question there are people who
1:07:57
argue and i've never understood the logic of this that a radical ought to dissociate
1:08:02
himself from all oppressive institutions that is the logic of that argument is that karl
1:08:08
marx shouldn't have studied in the british museum which if anything was the symbol of
1:08:14
you know the most vicious imperialism in the world the place where all the treasures of empire were gathered you know the rape
1:08:20
of the colonies was all poured in there and so on and so forth but i think karl marx was quite right in studying in the
1:08:26
british museum he was right in using the resources and in fact the liberal values
1:08:31
of the civilization that he was trying to overcome against it
1:08:37
and i think the same applies in this case but aren't you afraid that your presence at mit gives them a clean conscience
1:08:45
i don't see how really i mean i think my presence at mit serves marginally to
1:08:53
i hope a lot i don't know how much to increase student activism against a lot of the things that mit stands for for
1:08:58
example um ladies and gentlemen i think this has to be the end of the debate
1:09:07
mr chomsky mr foucault i thank you very much for your
1:09:12
fargoing discussion both the technical theoretical way as the political way
1:09:19
i thank you very much both at the part of the audience here and at home
1:09:34
[Applause] me
