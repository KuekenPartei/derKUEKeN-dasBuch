0:00
I think music is probably a better metaphor at least for Consciousness than his computation Dr Stuart hammeroff is a
0:06
professor of anesthesiology and psychology at the University of Arizona he's best known for his work on Quantum
0:12
Consciousness a theory he's co-created with sir Roger Penrose does Neuroscience need a revolution to understand
0:18
Consciousness and I believe it does it's also a theory that's been highly disputed by the scientific Community
0:24
does our brain really operate like a supercomputer or is it actually more like a Quantum Orchestra I think you
0:31
need microtubules and I think you need these coherent vibrations tune in for more about the true nature of
0:38
Consciousness welcome everybody to what promises to be a wild tour through
0:43
Consciousness imagination and the human brain a sample of which I brought here
0:49
for today's renowned guest my friend second time appearance on the into the
0:55
impossible podcast it's Professor Dr Stuart hammeroff the University of
1:00
Arizona where he is a professor of anesthesiology and psychology and the
1:07
director of the center for Consciousness studies where there were plans for the last year because I get these emails
1:14
every year and I spoke many years ago at this conference when it was last in San Diego
1:19
and they just had a phenomenal Conference held up in Encinitas I guess
1:25
um for the center for Consciousness featuring our good old friend sir Roger Penrose who's coming up on 93 I think
1:30
next week I think he just no you just turned 93 yeah that's right Stuart how are you very well Brian it's good to see
1:36
you again yeah I'm Glad You Came uh get us get to escape the Heat and come into the kitchen here in San Diego I'm what
1:42
you call a Zoni in this part of the country so we do call you we see but you usually leave around Labor Day so that's
1:49
nice uh so we get our we get our beaches back I got the hint
Judging the symposium by its cover
1:54
not you personally we love having your hair uh so you've been on before you came on last time with sir Roger uh but
1:59
this time I wanted to get an in-depth look into your research what drives you passions and also to answer some
2:07
questions that I've had about Consciousness for a very long time but I thought first we'd do something that we
2:13
always do on this podcast we we do a feature that we call judging books by their covers you don't have a book today
2:20
that we're discussing but I thought we'd look at the uh the cover of the Symposium the artwork for the Symposium
2:27
and the last time I was here uh I spoke at it in 2017 I can't believe it uh was
2:33
uh there was a brain riding a surfboard somehow in La Jolla so anyway can you
2:38
explain the origin story and judge the Symposium by its cover well the recent
2:44
Symposium uh was uh does Neuroscience need a revolution to understand Consciousness and I believe it does and
2:51
this particular conference which is kind of a satellite conference of our usual Consciousness conferences uh uh was a a
2:58
result of the last two a SSC conference conferences which ascc is kind of the other uh large uh uh conference annual
3:07
conference on Consciousness they tend to be more conservative they are more academic but they don't really deal with
3:12
Consciousness so much as cognition metacognition language what Dave Chalmers called the easy problems and uh
3:21
the last two ascc conferences have featured theories of Consciousness but didn't include ours even though they
3:28
were centered on the Templeton Foundation adversarial collaboration program which poured a lot of money into
3:34
Consciousness research and lasts for years and originally there were five theories uh integrated information
3:39
Theory Global neuronal workspace uh predictive coding and higher order
3:44
Theory and ours orchestrated objective reduction and the other four are really what I call kind of wiring diagrams of
3:52
information flow in the brain without really dealing with any biology they're kind of you know information goes this
3:58
way it goes that way and then it all converges and that's where Consciousness is and so their their collaborations
4:03
were based on where is consciousness is it in the front of the brain is in the back of the brain there was one particular one between IIT and Global
4:10
neuronal workspace on whether it's the front of the brain in the back of the brain and five million dollars later
4:16
they had a big showdown at the ASAC conference and they couldn't decide it was conflicting and uh and so it was a
4:23
big big tie and also uh Chalmers and Christoph coke uh settled a bet from 25
4:29
years ago on whether there we'd have a neural correlative Consciousness in 25 years Dave had said no because he
4:37
believes in the hard problem the Consciousness is essentially unsolvable and Chris said yes we'll have a neural
4:42
correlate in 25 well 25 years later Kristoff had admit we we don't even though he's a big advocate of uh IIT uh
4:50
he had to admit that that it wasn't convincing anyway they didn't consider
4:56
our Theory and as I told Christoph and Dave you know we've already shown that Quantum effects and microtubules are inhibited by anesthesia and therefore
5:02
the neural correlative Consciousness should be in microtubules at a deeper level within the brain but they only
5:08
consider neurons as simple on off switches they only consider the hodgkin-huxley 1950s era membrane-only
5:16
ion propagation signaling along the membrane you know Touring that is a
5:22
computable algorithmic neuron and the brain's not like that if you put electrodes inside cortical pyramidal
5:29
cells they're non-algorithmic they have some some other feature other than membrane adjusting the threshold from B
5:35
to beat a great place for Consciousness to come in and and adjust things and modify what is otherwise
5:41
automatic Behavior so um because we weren't part of the adversary we tried
5:48
to have an adversarial collaboration with IIT and we had a meeting in early 2020 just before covid in 2 some with
5:55
Julio tanoni and Christoph kolk and Roger and honor Bond and and other colleagues of of mine of ours on the
6:02
orcor on the microtubule side but we couldn't uh the idea in the adversary
6:07
collaboration was to have one one experiment that if it went one way would prove one theory if it went the other would prove the other it'd be a decisive
6:14
experiment yes and we couldn't and we couldn't uh come come up with anything
6:19
because number one I don't think IIT is falsifiable and number two we're at a deeper level and our Theory would be uh
6:27
it's talking about Quantum effects and microtubules inside neurons faster deeper Quantum and would be consistent
6:33
with any of the other theories which are more like wiring diagrams or even phrenology maps on the surface of the of
6:38
the skull so uh that kind of fell through but Templeton generously gave us
6:43
two hundred thousand dollars to do two experiments uh both of which turned out very favorable to us one of which is
6:50
published and the other one uh will be coming out soon when I had on David charm Mars he graciously came on last
The Orch OR theory
6:56
year for his new book and he's from Australia and I asked him that the
7:02
following question which I want to ask you if I were to have on AC DC the most popular band besides maybe Olivia
7:10
Newton-John rest in peace from the land down under of Australia and I were not
7:16
to ask them to play their song You Know Back In Black I would be worth nothing
7:22
as a podcaster so I want to ask you uh your greatest hit I asked him for his
7:28
greatest hit to find the hard problem of Consciousness and and he did and that was wonderful I want you and your words
7:34
to describe what is orc or okay as I said most theories look at the brain as
7:40
a complex computer of simple neurons so if you have complex enough interactions
7:45
and you're they're wired up in the proper circuitry then Consciousness emerges at a critical level of complex
7:52
interactions but but the neurons themselves are simple on off switches no different than what you would find in a
7:58
computer and functionally and this has been the idea and this this grew out of
8:04
Hodgkin Huxley which lends itself very well to uh algorithmic neurons uh by
8:09
biological and then computation and you know the brain's Consciousness in the brain has always been likened to the
8:15
current information processing technology going back to the Greeks with a seal ring and wax for memory and then
8:22
Telegraph switching circuits uh uh the Hologram uh smoke signal well maybe not
8:28
smoke signals but uh and then uh the computer of course the last uh 50 years
8:34
it's been the computer and AI has come along and run with that idea and say when we get complex enough or we get
8:40
enough this or that we'll have Consciousness and I think that's completely wrong because I follow Roger's idea the Consciousness is
8:46
non-computational and there's something other than computation something other than a turing machine going on right so with the orc or component of it relates
8:54
to quantum mechanics and non-computability how how so if you look at one neuron like as as I said if you
9:00
put an electrode into a pyramidal cell which I think is the most likely place
9:05
on this in the cortex the layer five pyramidal cells um for reasons I could go into but uh
9:10
and you measure the membrane uh the the kind of the input output you find that
9:16
the threshold for firing it's supposed to be integration on the dendrites and Soma to a threshold reach that that
9:22
triggers the firing and that's a one or a zero and that lends itself to computation and so it's all depend on
9:28
input versus output which is algorithmic and touring however they found that there were very there's a variability in
9:34
the threshold firing threshold on a B2B basis on a firing to firing basis so there was something other than than the
9:42
membrane or even a field coming in from the outside because that would affect the membrane let me just interject just
9:47
for clarification for my audience you know because if I'm a little bit unclear I'm sure that they might also be So when
9:55
you say that the threshold changes it would be as if you have still zeros and ones but the threshold to trigger in a
10:01
you know transistor-based computer it'd be as if they're that threshold would not be zero on five volts it would be
10:07
some intermediate value that itself would change over time yes it changes on a fire to firing basis and uh that was
10:15
uh they kind of everybody kind of glossed over that well it's it's artifact it's noise it's this it's that but I it isn't and I mean uh and and
10:23
that is actually a perfect place for Consciousness to come in because if we're algorithmic if we're totally
10:29
computational then there's no possibility of free will there's no create uh creativity there's no
10:35
imagination it's all we're all basically a computer not many people believe that we have no Free Will and Sam Harris
The problem of free will
10:41
Sabina hasenfelder many people believe in super determinism and so I know that's not a problem for them but I know
10:47
that but if you want to I actually I don't believe that we don't have free will and I've never met somebody I don't know have you you might have you ever
10:54
met someone who acts in accordance with a perspective that they have no free will in other words Sam Harris I don't
10:59
think that he goes around thinking I I have no free will so therefore I'm going to act in accordance with that fact in
11:05
other words he sees it as a have you ever encountered a patient perhaps that uh maybe in psychological settings
11:11
I believe that like you know if they did something wrong they cheated on their wife that it's because of the big bang you know is there something like that uh
11:19
well there could be but I think there's a there's a bigger problem with free will which is that uh if you say something
11:26
and I say something in it and uh if if we somebody looks at my brain at the
11:31
activity recording or or processing what you said I will have already responded to you yes
11:37
or a baseball player uh actually swings the bat uh it doesn't really have enough
11:44
time to know where the the ball is and uh going back to the experiments of Benjamin libbit 1979 uh where he had
11:51
patients awake in surgery with their brains exposed and could do physiological tests uh there's he he
11:57
found that the brain refers information backward in time and uh Roger wrote about this in his book The Emperor's New
12:03
mind and I I then looked up a little bit and studied him intensely and basically Roger uh argues that every collapse
12:10
sends Quantum information both forward and backward in time and Arona of says
12:15
the same thing and others do too so uh backward time up it is allowable in quantum physics up up to a point you do
12:22
have the grandfather causal Paradox problem but but if if you you can get around that or you can avoid it by just
12:29
not affecting anything that hasn't collapsed yet so this backward time effect actually enables you enables us
12:37
to act in in real time so even though the activity process and what you said hasn't happened yet it's going backward
12:43
in time so I can answer you consciously but but the the phase space or the parameter space isn't infinite in other
12:49
words if the baseball pitcher you know throwing a pitch it's not going to you know emerge from from The Dugout it's
12:54
going to emerge from his hand there's a parameter space so that narrows down the batter's ability to actually judge and
12:59
there is you know it's it's not that it's a causal it's they're basing their swing pattern uh on the actual you know
13:06
probability that they've witnessed over thousands of pitches in the case of a well that's that's the uh the mainstream
13:12
explanation and that may be true but uh a guy named Robert Adair uh wrote a book called the science of the Swing about
13:18
this and and it would argued against that same thing with Cricket and tennis and so forth and even rapid fire
13:23
conversation and there's a lot of experimental evidence for it also unfortunately if it's in the
13:29
parapsychology literature it gets written off as exp as parasite apology but there's a lot of precognition
13:34
there's some very mainstream studies showing uh uh effects from the near future right but getting back to the
Elaborating on the Orch OR theory
13:41
actual orc or Theory so when we when we talk about can you sum that up in a way that you know a lay person can
13:47
understand it because I've had trouble I know other physicists have trouble understanding it
13:52
um and and I know you're not a physicist but you've been intimately involved you're the one person that Roger
13:57
responded to from the emperor's new mind uh back which was the first book I ever read as a science you know hungry kid
14:03
but but I want to ask you so the orchestrated let's break it down what is orc o r stand for and then what do each
14:10
one of those terms mean in Lay persons terms please okay or is Roger's uh theory for collapse of the wave function
14:16
to do due to general relativity or quantum gravity however you want to describe it I'll come to that in a
14:22
second orc is really what's happening in the microtubules so let me put this in a temperate perspective when I was in
14:27
medical school I was interested in the brain mind problem Consciousness but neurology a Neurosurgery Psychiatry
14:33
didn't really grab me as especially to spend my life doing I did a research elective in a cancer
14:39
lab was studying mitosis how cells divide how these structures microtubules
14:44
mitotic spindles would grab the chromosomes and they're all uh Tangled
14:49
Tangled Up and and mixed up and grabbed them in perfect Pairs and separate them
14:54
to form the daughter cells so they had to know where uh where to go what to do
15:00
there they needed to have some kind of intelligence or possibly Consciousness everybody else in the lab got fascinated
15:06
by the chromosomes and this was the dawn of the genetic Revolution and they probably made billions in genetic
15:11
engineering and so forth I got really fascinated with how these structures these microtubules knew where to go and
15:17
what to do I was interested in Consciousness at that same time in the early 70s it was discovered that the
15:23
microtubules were in all cells not just mitotic spindles including neurons they were chock full neurons were chock full
15:28
of them prior to that the fixative agent had for electron microscopy been dissolving them and I and the X-ray
15:36
diffraction crystallography of microtubule came out from Amos and klug in in the UK and it was a it was a like
15:42
a crystalline lattice of individual proteins in a helical geometry with Fibonacci geometry which I thought was
15:48
really interesting and uh and they were in neurons and uh and they looked like computers I was also learning about
15:54
computers for the first time about Boolean switching matrices and I looked at the structure of microtubule and a
16:00
Boolean switching I said you know they look like computers maybe they're processing information as little computers and that's how they know where
16:06
to go and what to do and and organize stuff inside the cells and so I developed some theories and models and
16:12
worked with physicists at Los Alamos Steen Rasmus and Jack josinski Stephen Smith and others modeling microtubo says
16:20
automata like cellular automata each protein subunit could be a one or a zero interacting with its neighbors and we
16:26
showed that we could get propagating patterns and information and they could be pretty good computers especially if
16:32
you hook them up side by side in opposite directions as we have inside neurons inside dendrites so uh have
16:38
people built on is this a sign have they built you know a squishy wet computers using microtubules and not you know
16:44
maybe not human subjects but have they they're smaller uh honor bond has developed uh what he
16:50
calls brain jelly which is an organic polymer that self-organizes in a helical fashion which is based on microtubules
16:56
that he says is a quantum computer it's an organic quantum computer room temperature and that's he just got big
17:03
fun Big Time funding in India to develop that but uh I'm getting ahead of myself so I was going around the 70s and 80s to
17:11
neural net and AI meetings and where you know Curtis Wells talking about the singularity we get to 10 to the 16th
17:18
operations per second they were looking at the brain as 10 10 to the 11th neurons uh a thousand synapses and about
17:25
100 Hertz gives you 10 to the 16th operations per second so kurzuel actually this came from Hans moravik in
17:31
the in the in the 80s I read his book uh mine children I think and then kurzwa
17:36
picked it up and said well when we get to that's the brain capacity 10 to the 16th operations per second when we get
17:42
there we'll have Consciousness in a computer because he's coming on the podcast next early next year so look
17:47
forward to sharing your ideas with them okay and uh and I had calculated that
17:53
microtubules there were about a billion tubulins switching in say 10 megahertz gave you 10 to the 16th operations per
18:00
neuron so I was I was going on being a real pain in the butt to them saying no there's way way more information going
18:07
on and if you multiply the 10 to the 16th per neuron times the 10 to the 11th neurons you get 10 to the 27th
18:13
operations per second so I I was moving their goal post if they wanted to believe me way way Downstream so they
18:19
didn't want to believe me they didn't like that it made their you know because they were saying give us a few more billion and we'll have a conscious
18:25
computer and I say no no it's like 30 40 50 years in the future you know so they said get out of here kid you bother me
18:30
you know and so uh anyway one day somebody said okay wise guy let's say
18:36
you're right how would that explain Consciousness and it was the hard problem thrown in my face this is five
18:41
years before Dave uh Chalmers discussed the hard problem other people
18:47
including John Searle had described it in other ways I had to realize I had to admit that this guy was right I didn't
18:54
have a mechanism for Consciousness you know feelings love joy the color pink the Blue Sky whatever taste smell of
19:02
coffee I had no idea it was these were qualia and uh fortunately that person
19:07
recommended I read Roger's book uh the emperor's new mind which I did and uh he
19:13
the first part of the book was arguing against the idea that Consciousness is a computation through girdle's theorem
19:18
that mathematical theorem can't prove itself you have to have somebody outside a conscious mathematician and he said
19:26
therefore for understanding you have to be outside the computational system the classical competition the touring
19:31
touring machine idea something outside that and for that you had to leave
19:37
classical physics you had to go to quantum physics and for that you had to arrive at the at the single most um
19:44
mysterious issue in Quantum physic which is the measurement problem a collapse of the wave function and as you know in
19:51
quantum physics at small scales and maybe large scales but at least the small scales things can be in multiple States or locations at the same time but
19:57
when measured or observed they seem to collapse to one or the other now some people say that doesn't happen in each
20:03
possibility branches off and forms its own universe or decoherence does it some
20:08
people say that Consciousness causes collapse none of those are really satisfactory and in this book The
20:13
Emperor's New mind Roger came up with his own new idea that there was a self-collapse and to explain that he
20:20
brought in general relativity which is a neat trick in and of itself because quantum physics in general relativity
20:25
generally don't Jive but he likened the position of a particle or a particle to
20:32
tiny curvatures in space-time now Einstein had done it for big things like the sun bending light behind the Stars
20:37
so that Eddington can see the stars behind the Sun and that proved the space-time curvature Roger did it for
20:45
tiny things so a tiny particle would have a tiny curvature in space-time and if it was in superposition of being here
20:50
and here it would have two curvatures it would be a separation in underlying space-time geometry and he used these
20:56
simple two-dimensional space-time sheets to illustrate and you can imagine that if the curvature is separated
21:02
indefinitely you'd have multiple worlds but he's and you can imagine if somebody looked at it and caused collapsed it
21:08
would go to one or the other without explaining what the Consciousness was out here but he said the separations
21:14
were unstable and after a Time T would collapse to one or the other and when that happened it would give a moment of
21:20
proto-conscious experience a qualia and this was the only mechanism ever
21:26
proposed that I know of and still to this day for a generation of qualia of of Consciousness the wave function of
21:31
what because there's there's an infinite number of uh systems in the that you
21:37
could describe right is it every electron collapses their wave function What wave function are we talking about
21:42
that yeah that's the beauty of it he used space-time curvature so it doesn't matter because any superposition of
21:48
anything would cut would be would be a separation in in space-time geometry so
21:53
it in principle would work for any superposition now to work in the brain is another question but but it would
21:59
mean and it still means that there are superpositions separating and collapsing in the table in the air everywhere
22:06
ubiquitously throughout the Universe and uh these collapses would be random uh
22:12
disconnected lack memory like me you know that context and would be what uh he calls uh and I call now
22:19
proto-conscious and this may seem bizarre that these proto-conscious events are happening everywhere but if
22:24
you're a pan psychist and many neuroscientists have resorted to pansychism because Neuroscience doesn't
22:29
work for Consciousness uh then you have the issue that everything is conscious
22:35
including this fake brain including the table so it's the same thing but then you have the problem how do you combine
22:40
them into the kind of unified Consciousness we have and you can't do that for pan psychism but for Quantum
22:46
you can because of entanglement so and this relies on yeah gravitational
22:51
effects which are far you know literally 40 orders of magnitude smaller than you
22:56
know special relativistic effects or electromagnetic effects how do they evade the decoherence time scales that
23:03
you know even in a simplistic many worlds interpretation are happening 10 to the 30th times per second and how do
23:09
they persist long enough for us to have that 100 Hertz which is one you know hundredth of a second perception of
23:15
qualia or whatever else right well everybody says the brain's too warm wet and noisy for delicate Quantum effects
23:22
because you want to build a quantum computer you go to the laboratory and do it absolutely right we have a dilution refrigerator so I'll take you down to
23:27
point zero zero one Kelvin right right yeah for that purpose but the brain is not uh and the brain is mostly water
23:33
however the brain is not homogeneous the brain is not just one big slab with the
23:38
same amount of water everywhere the brain is highly heterogeneous and anesthesiologist is an im1 and
23:44
pharmacologists know that if you give a molecule to a an organism if we give a
23:50
drug to a patient it will go in that in that patient to where it dissolves to where it's soluble and drugs have
23:56
different solubility so most drugs are polar they're soluble in water and blood and they go to charge receptors on
24:02
membrane surfaces but anesthetics which are so Collective for erasing
24:08
Consciousness and have very very little very little other effects on the brain and uh they they go to nonpolar areas uh
24:16
fat like regions lipid-like regions they're basically oil kind of like the Benzene ring and oil and water don't mix
24:22
so in proteins all the the aromatic rings of amino acids which is the basis
24:28
for organic chemistry and a key player in in Quantum biology these organic Rings uh coalesce inside proteins and so
24:36
we have these regions of nonpolar water free because water oil and water don't
24:41
mix and they exclude water that support quantum Optical effects and it's these Quantum Optical effects which then
24:47
coupled to the nucleus to have enough superposition movement and superposition to reach threshold uh that gives you
24:54
Quantum effects uh in uh at Island temperature and uh wets yes it's an
24:59
adiabatic system you have a Quantum system a decoherence free Subs subsystem
25:04
inside a polar Shield more or less so let's go back to the microtubules
25:10
themselves because you're an expert in this field so microtubules exist in all cells correct right but is there
25:17
anything different about their qualities inside of the brain yes for one thing they're more uh more variable
25:24
genetically there are 22 ISO isozymes isoforms of tubulin in in the brain
25:30
you're only 11 in most other tissues and then you can have uh post-translational modifications uh perfect for memory uh
25:36
memory encoding so you can have a roughly 30 different types of tubulin and there's a billion per neuron in
25:44
these lattices and uh in the dendrites and Soma the microtubules are they're
25:51
kind of permanently they're capped on both ends so they don't add at one end and lose with the other they don't have
25:57
what's called Dynamic instability where they shatter and re-polymerize they don't have to disassemble and get
26:03
involved in mitosis cell division which they do in all other cells because because neurons don't divide once they're formed
26:09
they don't divide which means that the neuron that the microtubules can stay in their particular lattice configuration
26:15
and each one of those tubulins can be in one of 30 so it's kind of a mosaic and
26:21
so that's a perfect mechanism for memory which is and I think microtubules store memory it can't be synapses because the
26:28
synaptic proteins only last hours to days in memories last lifetimes and the synapses are upregulated and done
26:34
regulated by microtubules and we've shown how memory can be encoded from synaptic events into the microtubules
26:40
and the dendritic microtubules are are capped so they're stable over the
26:46
lifetime presumably the lifetime of individuals and they don't have to disassemble uh for for mitosis and in
26:54
dendrites and Soma they're in this very strange mixed polarity Network so microtubules of a plus end and a minor
27:00
set in all cells they're unipolar with the uh beta Plus in my Alpha minus out
27:07
like spokes of a wheel and in an axon they're also in unipolar in a a parallel
27:14
bundle in dendrites and Soma they're broken interrupted and they're part of the cytoskeleton so
27:20
if they're skeletal you wouldn't want to break your femur and in half and have one go it doesn't make any sense there
27:25
must be something else so you have one going one way one the other and they're in these mixed polarity networks which
27:31
uh which uh allow for recursive processing and also interference beats
27:36
so if they're oscillating and say megahertz and they're slightly different energies because they're going to be in
27:43
the the external membrane is going to affect them slightly differently they're going to interfere and give slower beats
27:48
and that's how you get from say megahertz uh two kilohertz to Hertz to EEG in fact we
27:55
think EEG is generated by microtubule oscillation interference can you explain to me how anesthesia the conventional
How does anesthesia actually work?
28:03
model for how anesthesia actually works the convention most people would say anesthesia acts on membrane proteins
28:09
receptors Gaba receptors acetylcholine receptors serotonin Glycine and maybe a
28:14
few others on the dendritic side however uh not all anesthetics there's this
28:20
unitary feature of anesthesia if uh if you uh if you rank them all in potency
28:26
that potency correlates perfectly with their solubility in olive oil of all
28:32
things the aromatic nonpolar region of like aromatic ranks like tryptophan phenylalanine so if that holds over many
28:38
many orders of magnitude and uh and so they all should act the same way but not
28:43
all anesthetics bind to all receptors they don't all all bind to Gaba receptors and there's never been any
28:49
studies showing a correlation between anesthetic action on membrane receptors
28:54
and and potency and in fact the leader in the the world leader in anesthetic
29:01
mechanism uh research a guy at UCSF who's passed away now Ted eager yeah when I was when I was uh in residency he
29:08
was the guy I mean and uh at UCSF and the expert in anesthetic mechanism and so forth and he and he uh he he and his
29:16
team worked to find which receptor or receptors media anesthetic action and
29:22
after 20 years he gave up in 2008 he wrote this paper and said that we need a new paradigm this is not it's not member
29:29
receptors for one goes up one goes down there's no unitary action and uh I told him at the time I said you should look
29:35
at microtubules but uh he didn't want to do that but uh since then Rod eckenhoff's group at University of
29:41
Pennsylvania has been doing uh systematic Research into anesthetic mechanism and found for example 70
29:48
different proteins in a cell and a neuron that bind anesthetics and about half of the membrane half in the
29:54
cytoplasm cytoplasm including tubulin so tubulin does bind uh uh anesthetics and
30:01
genomic and proteomic studies showed that the gene expression changed the most for tubulin suggesting that's the
30:07
functional effect and they also did optogenetics where they had a fluorescent anesthetic that only uh only
30:14
acted as an anesthetic when you hit it with UV light and they gave it to these tadpoles and uh they swam around and
30:20
fortunately tadpoles have transparent heads so they can then illuminate with with ultraviolet light and when they did
30:25
that they all went belly up the anesthetic became active and they donated their little brains to science
30:30
and they found that the anesthetic was bound to tubular microtubules and also people on the the drug texol which
30:37
stabilizes microtubules it's an anti-cancer drugs so the the they can't
30:42
disassemble uh for mitosis uh require more anesthesia that also came out of uh
30:48
eckenhoff's lab so there's circumstantial uh evidence it's not uh I
30:53
think there's far more for a microtubules than anything else despite that the party line is still membrane receptors and how does it relate to say
31:01
a drug you know a uh you know barbiturate or some sort of a depressant or something like how does anesthesia
31:06
which you I don't know phenobarbital what do you what's the most common one that uh so how does that relate to say you know
31:14
a classic you know schedule one narcotic are they related at all well narcotics
31:20
act that opiate receptors primarily however if you give enough fentanyl for example uh you get a
31:27
general anesthetic but they're really uh they're really supposedly specific for
31:33
opiate receptors propofol and the anesthetics follow the Meyer Overton correlation and therefore they should
31:42
have a common uh a common mode of Action Now propofol does bind to Gaba receptors and everybody as well they act on gab
31:48
receptors but they also get inside the cell in fact it was recently shown that that psychedelics also act inside the
31:55
cell that there are five ht2a receptors inside the neuron in the microtubule
32:00
Associated protein so it it's it's likely that psychedelics act inside neurons directly on more directly on
32:07
microtubules as do anesthetics interesting and there's some quantum physics or say related to things like
Stuartâ€™s interest in quantum physics
32:14
spintronics or the ising model things like that what's sort of the work in the physical quote-unquote hard Sciences
32:20
that's been most you know provocative to you in an interesting way I actually worked with Isaac models and
32:27
and uh microtubules as icing models are cellular automata molecular automata where each tubulin was a uh could be a
32:34
single single state but I think that's that's too simplistic and I think probably the most significant work has
32:39
been done by my friend honor Bond banyapad who works at the National Institute of materials Sciences In Scuba
32:46
Japan who started working on microtubules in around 2009 after reading uh uh some of our papers and uh
32:54
he he started out studying he's a nanotechnologist to begin with and he started out studying individual
33:00
microtubules with four electrodes two to record and two to stimulate and if you
33:05
stimulate a microtubule um let's say with a DC Uh current a DC voltage or a voltage it's a good
33:12
insulator however if you uh put a current on an ultra alternating at
33:18
different frequencies AC curve and sweep the sweep the frequencies you'll find certain frequency bands where the
33:24
microtubule becomes highly conductive almost uh almost superconductive he
33:30
calls it ballistic conducted and this happens every three orders of magnitude in uh in in hertz kilohertz megahertz
33:38
gigahertz and terahertz and and each in each level the the conductance band is a
33:45
it's what he calls A Triplet of triplets there's three Peaks and each Peak has three Peaks and this triplet of triplet
33:50
repeats and kilohertz megahertz gigahertz and terahertz and so it's kind
33:56
of like a resonant Orchestra or something in one you know microtubes themselves are these uh uh incredible
34:03
Quantum vibrational devices basically based on KT you don't have to pump them you don't have to give them energy it's
34:09
just they take Ambient Energy and vibrate in these frequencies so he discovered that and I'm really itching
34:15
to see anesthetical facts and we're discussing doing uh building a a gas a
34:21
chamber where we can have airtight control and and study quantum effects microtubules with effects of anesthesia
34:27
so uh he did that and then in a couple years ago he studied a neural network
34:34
and and with these uh dielectric resonance probes inside the neurons in
34:39
the network and found uh gigahertz he can measure gigahertz and megahertz oscillations in the dendrites and Soma
34:45
that controlled the firing more so than the membrane potential so here was a
34:50
perfect example of uh the microtubules overriding membrane effects which is
34:57
exactly what you want for Consciousness to overcome automatic Behavior so you're driving down the road and you're
35:03
daydreaming or mind wandering and then somebody stores in front of you your Consciousness takes over and uh it's not
35:10
coming from outside because you wouldn't you would see it in the membrane potential so it must be coming from inside or it's likely to be coming from
35:16
inside and this would explain exactly in fact he's demonstrated that and then more recently he's been able to detect
35:23
megahertz and gigahertz from the scalp with a single electrode and now an array and he calls this the ddg the dodecagram
35:30
uh which is essentially ultra high frequency EEG where you can measure at
35:36
least megahertz and gigahertz from the scale and we did some some fooling
35:41
around with that uh while he was here he brought a device and showed uh uh triplet of triplets from my head and
35:48
others and uh and we tried it on a dog and we got it we got a megahertz Peak we
35:54
tried it on a on an apple and did not see anything and we tried it on a plant and actually at right where the stem and
36:01
the root combined we saw some megahertz activity so Mike uh plants have have
36:06
microtubules I think you know uh plants are are could be conscious at a very low
36:11
frequency so you know I think we have for example 10 million orcowar moments
36:17
per second and uh that interferes down to give EEG and cognition so forth whereas a a plant
36:24
might have a couple per minute so it could be at the base level you know people argue as much about you know what
Artificial intelligence and brain organoids
36:29
is consciousness as they do about what is life right so it could be that you know only living things are conscious if
36:35
uh you know no I I don't mean currently alive but those that have capability to be alive you have a an apple maybe it's
36:41
cut off from you know actual you know cellular mitosis and so forth but um but
36:46
you know the pan psychic notion should have a restriction on it in my opinion I I don't support pan psychism myself but
36:54
uh but but as as intriguing possibility allows people to kind of get around some various conundrum I want to ask you um
37:01
about two two relevant things that have been really popular topics for me and very interesting for me to study lately
37:07
uh one has to do with artificial intelligence and natural stupidity uh but the other
37:13
one has to do with brain organoids so we had our good friend uh Professor Allison motrion early this year actually he was
37:20
our first in studio guest we'll put a link to that up somewhere over here uh in the new studio here at UC San Diego
37:26
and uh and he devised you know the detailed many great developments that
37:31
are going on brain organized and so forth like what are the kind of base level Primitives that you could distill
37:37
you know a brain to Consciousness to is it like an organoid I mean what would be the ideal you know control and variable
37:45
kind of setup for a classic decisive experiment in this field well I've been discussing this actually and Allison and
37:52
I wrote a paper on on uh trying to detect look for Consciousness in brain
37:57
organoids and I thought it was pretty good paper actually and the the main feature was that he's he sees uh
38:05
rhythmic uh rhythmic Dynamics at different frequencies and they're face coupled kind of like uh kind of like the
38:12
megahertz gigahertz activity the different scales but it wasn't that much of a difference in in frequency and uh
38:19
so uh one idea was whether they were coupled or not and I I would think that if they
38:25
were if the organ I was conscious there would be uncoupling of the phase because if if you're just everything's in phase
38:32
and you're on automatic pilot and you're you're unconscious whereas uh I think you want to uh you want to decouple and
38:39
and that's where Consciousness could come in so that's one of the things we put in that paper and uh my friend uh
38:46
Hartman Nevin at Google and his uh friends at uh UC Santa Barbara are trying to uh entangle an organoid with
38:54
the quantum system and uh so that'll be interesting I personally think that uh it's the organizer is already too
39:01
complicated they should try to entangle microtubules and in fact honor bond has shown entanglement between two microtubules interesting so that is the
39:08
Primitive base level that could be the most useful sort of uh building block Lego for studying Consciousness in some
39:14
sense I think uh for the I think you need microtubules and uh I think you need these coherent vibrations megahertz
39:22
gigahertz and uh you know with this uh device we're measuring megahertz and I think at this point in time that
39:29
megahertz uh uh from the brain is probably as good a candidate for a neural correlative
39:35
Consciousness as there is because we can measure it you know from our little studies it was it was reproducible uh
39:42
animals have it plants seem to have it uh inanimate objects do not have it and uh and we also tried stimulating with uh
39:50
transcranial ultrasound and uh we found uh on one side and measured from the other and we found after a slight delay
39:57
an increase in activity so uh and transcran ultrasizes mechanical vibrations in megahertz uh which does
40:05
cause mental effects after a slight delay you get a a kind of a euphoric mood enhancement and a number of people
40:12
have been studying that what about the electromagnetic phenomena The Havana syndrome things like that are there
40:18
pertinent aspects that we could learn about Consciousness either from the claimed or real uh evidence that's been
40:24
presented for electromagnetic stimulation I would bet that Havana syndrome is some kind of effect on
40:30
microtubules it could be microwave gigahertz we know microtypo's resonated gigahertz it might be radio waves
40:36
megahertz but if you if you over resonate
40:42
something like the bridge you know that over over it's gonna it's gonna shatter and I think that's exactly what happened
40:48
and in fact concussion uh concussion is in concussion your microtubules get get fractured and broken and that's been
40:54
well proven and uh so it's it's a lot like a post-concussion syndrome interesting uh last thing before we take
AI, Neuralink, and other brain-computer interfaces
41:01
uh audience questions um has to do with these you know human brain computational augmentation systems
41:09
things like neuralink and so forth I'd like to get your uh impression of those what what are the prospects we've we've
41:15
had uh Noam Chomsky on a long time ago talked about his pessimism that this is
41:20
uh not really pertinent to how Consciousness is really organized or presented uh what are your thoughts as a
41:27
as a someone who's deeper in this field than gnome certainly is if you're talking about uh bring
41:33
computer interface interface with uh EEG forget it uh the EEG is way too crude
41:39
it's way uh you know uh anything's going to be washed out uh you might have a
41:45
better better chance with this megahertz and uh you know which I think is going to convey a lot more uh information and
41:52
also has the advantage of uh uh uh this guy at the conference Patrick palucky pointed out that uh that the a big
42:00
problem with uh brand computer interface with EEG is that blink artifact or facial movement it screws it all up and
42:07
we showed in with our megahertz device that you can blink all you want and you can make faces and it doesn't change one
42:12
bit so it would be better for that uh aspect and also you get way more information absolutely so we have a
42:21
large number of questions from Twitter and from I didn't get to answer about AI oh yeah you say one thing yeah I was
42:27
gonna yeah let's go uh there's a guy Brian romelly uh you know I've seen him
42:32
on Twitter and he's been on James also so he asked chat GPT how what's the most
42:37
likely way for you to become conscious and chat GPT said the best way no I
42:42
won't I won't use your Hal voice he's your Hal voices
42:50
said the the best way is through Penrose hamroth Orco Arthur and went on with a
42:55
pretty nice exposition of the of the theory really uh but let's let's talk about AI generally uh not just uh you
43:02
know the the chat chat Bots and stuff we have a bribot by the way she can find my website you can interact with me and ask
43:07
me your questions uh as Brian the other Brian did but um tell me Stuart what do you think is uh sort of the the promise
43:15
the pitfalls The Perils of this kind of Singularity of AI that seems to be upon
43:20
us or will be imminently so I don't think AI is going to become conscious they may try to convince us it's
43:26
conscious but uh if it's just computation I don't think so you know maybe if somebody
43:32
builds a quantum computer with objective reduction possible but just more complexity more this more than it's no
43:39
it's not going to be it may you know it may fool some people but I don't think it's be conscious it could still be
43:45
dangerous but um not not because of its conscious I still think it's uh interesting to get
43:52
your impression about this what you know Consciousness if we were to understand it it would it would certainly involve
43:59
things we can't really anticipate right now in terms of understanding who we are what we are but it's kind of like
44:04
cosmology another cos thing uh which is uh which is that it's incredibly
44:10
significant but it may not be important in other words like it won't affect our daily lives and Technology maybe
44:16
Consciousness would I want to get your impression about that but on the other hand it's clearer anesthesiology I mean
44:22
anesthesiology might be one of the most important inventions of all time right and so along with you know I I wrote a
44:29
chapter in 2000 uh this guy wrote a book The Greatest inventions of the past 2000
44:35
years and I wrote The Judge around anesthesia so we always have these you know revisionist histories where people
44:40
say you know if only our live and you know in the 1640s and and I would have just cleaned up I would have had all the
44:46
treasure and women but if you broke your leg you know we live better now than not
44:52
even just like 400 years ago we live better than like the Queen of England lived in the 1950s or 40s uh it's just
44:57
it's just uh unbelievable so in terms of benefit to humanity as Alfred Nobel you
45:03
know clearly wanted and what would what would create sort of a a bigger impact understanding Consciousness the base
45:10
layer of reality as we perceive it and there are as many different interpretations of quantum chaotics as
45:16
there are interpretations of Consciousness Donald Hoffman you know we've had them all on
45:21
um and no one can tell me what it's like to be a bat uh yet but I want to ask you which would have a bigger breakthrough
45:26
the advances in anesthesiology and brain computer interfaces and being able to control the brain versus understanding
45:33
what Consciousness is I think under well it depends what it turns out to be if we're right and
45:39
Consciousness is an intrinsic feature of the universe uh connecting us through multiple layers down to the fundamental
45:46
space-time geometry that would kind of Define our place in the universe and I think that would be important for uh not
45:53
just practical reasons medical reasons but also spiritual reasons philosophical reasons we would be connected uh it
46:01
would kind of change our outlook on the other hand if it turns out if it goes the other way and it's a emergent epiphenomenal process then who cares so
Audience questions
46:08
we've now reached the point in the conversation where I'd like to ask some questions from the audience so my friend
46:14
Dr Leonard Mo many uh who's a great scholar and friend of the show he asks
46:21
you the following question he asks what are your thoughts on Compton making connections between Heisenberg's
46:26
uncertainty principle and Free Will the uncertainty principle is the basis for
46:33
the orcor collapse so Rogers oh are collapsed it's t equals H bar over e sub
46:39
G so the larger the superposition the faster it will collapse and it's it's an
46:45
average so there's still some uncertainty it's got like a radioactive decay and that's what give gives you uh
46:51
Consciousness uh and and Action for free will but as I mentioned before uh
46:57
generally the brain activity is is too late so without uh backward time referral you don't have the even the
47:04
possibility for real-time conscious action and Consciousness would therefore be epi phenomenal and we have a false
47:10
illusion which most people think are the the the party line in neuroscience and philosophy starting from Dan Dennett and
47:18
uh uh Dan Wagner's book uh the illusion of free will is that uh free wills is an
47:24
illusion because the activity happens too late and our non-conscious autopilot
47:30
acts first although they never explain where the brain activity is for the non-conscious autopilot because that
47:35
should have some activity too and uh and then we have this false illusion after the fact that we were in control
47:41
Consciousness and illusion and uh the backward time effect rescues the possibility rescues conscious Free Will
47:47
Brad Caldwell on Twitter and reminder you can always ask questions of all my guests on Twitter at Dr Brian Katie and
47:53
YouTube Dr Brian Katie Instagram Dr Mary uh Brad Caldwell asked the following about the Triple Peak significance are
48:00
there any noticeable changes in such patterns during different conscious phases like sleep versus anesthetics
48:06
versus yeah we don't know yet uh the first thing I want to do is anesthesia I
48:12
I suspect that the the megahertz uh triplets I hope will be more sensitive
48:19
to Anesthesia than EEG if you if you look at EG gamma tends to go away and everything kind of slows down so it will
48:26
be interesting to see what happens to the megahertz and gigahertz with anesthesia and also perhaps with with
48:32
psychedelics I bet they go up I've got a lot of very brilliant people in my audience the next one is s case villain
48:39
K who asks or aside which what theory would you put your money on as a second
48:45
best guess I like recurrent processing uh predictive coding because it's uh it's
48:52
not uh it's more than just a wiring diagram it's a process that can happen at multiple levels in fact uh recurrent
48:59
processing happens as I said you have microtubules in opposite directions so information can go here and then here so
49:06
we did a paper 1990 with with two microtubules in opposite direction showing uh learning between these two
49:12
microtubules so I think recurrent processing and predictive coding is a fundamental process not just at the
49:19
neural level but all the way down including microtubules so that's my second favorite great John Hussein Kennedy asks are there any aromatic ring
49:27
structures that are non-carbon that could share the quantum properties of
49:32
benzene such as six silicon ring hexa Benzene it would have to have Pi
49:38
resonance and the the indole ring in tryptophan and a lot of the Psychedelic and serotonin a lot of the psychedelics
49:44
has a nitrogen in the in the five ring and so it doesn't have to be all carbon
49:50
but it has to allow a pie resonance uh orbital Robbie is asking specifically
49:56
I'm very interested in researching the properties of microtubules especially as wave guides ordered water very
50:02
interesting question the the water inside so water on any ordered surface
50:08
is is going to be ordered in other words it's not going to be just random water it's going to align with the charges and
50:15
the microtubules have a lot of charges and on the outside and also inside and
50:20
on the inside the water channel uh actually honor but I was talking about this yesterday the the water channel is
50:26
uh is in was he saying terahertz it's oscillating coherently in terahertz and in fact uh before I started working with
50:34
Roger in the 90s I wrote a paper with Quantum physicists from Japan uh Amari
50:40
jibu and kunio yasui and Carl Friedman was on that and Scott Hagan about uh
50:45
super Radiance in the water Channel inside microtubules and uh uh I I
50:52
thought originally the microt juice might be a wave guys for electromagnetics but it's kind of high energy because the wavelength would be
50:58
small however the centrioles are cilia which are not which are uh nine triplets
51:03
uh of of microtubules it's about 150 nanometers in diameter and that's a
51:10
perfect Optical wave guide and in fact uh Albrecht Bueller has shown that uh centrioles which are essentially cilia
51:16
to cilia detect photons and uh and and capture them and there's the silly in
51:23
every one of our rod and Cone cells and photons pass through them to get the rhodopsin in the back and I was talking
51:30
to somebody at the conference who agreed with me that it's likely that the silly it might be extracting Quantum and
51:35
information and sending them through the mouth and there's Mueller cells into the
51:41
brain other than the optic nerve so we may be detecting more than quite literally meets the eye Quantum
51:47
optically very good okay so next question uh comes from atai bark hey who
51:56
asks your thoughts on Matthew Fisher Posner molecule proposal where quantum
52:01
entanglement occurs in the brain but not via microtubules well first of all uh there's no Posner
52:08
cluster clusters in the brain uh as far as I can tell poster clusters are calcium phosphate crystals that might
52:15
happen in bone formation but not anything cognitive not anything information so they're not I don't see
52:22
how they'd be very useful to store information if you want a lattice the microtubos are perfect the other thing
52:28
the other problem with that is that lithium the Isotopes of lithium differ in their Mass significantly and so
52:35
you're not sure if the difference in isotope is due to the the spin or the or
52:40
the mass now there is a very interesting isotope effect in Consciousness which is
52:45
Xenon Xenon is an anesthetic it's a single atom inert uh atom and it's and
52:52
uh complete outer shells so it's nonpolar and it's a perfectly good anesthetic and follows Meyer Overton
52:58
anyway it can have different isozymes and a a group in China Study the potency
53:05
of the different isozymes and they found the one uh the one isozyme that had a
53:11
spin one half was significantly less potent than the other and they pass
53:17
postulated that the spin one half actually promoted Consciousness that
53:22
actually accelerated Consciousness and therefore the Xenon was antagonizing its
53:28
own anesthetic effect and I reviewed that paper for anesthesiology and they asked me to write a uh an editorial
53:34
which I did and so I elucidated exactly how the spin one-half might might
53:40
interact with the other Quantum stuff going on in the brain wow okay Tom Anderson Is frequent uh fan of the uh
53:46
podcast uh asked the following questions or evidence for Consciousness extending outside of the brain say in the entirety
53:53
of the nervous system well as I said there's proto-consciousness everywhere but I
53:58
think he might be referring to auto body experiences or near-death experiences or
54:04
even afterlife and uh I'm asked that question quite often and uh in my you know if
54:09
Consciousness is happening in space-time geometry it's conceivable that it could
54:15
when the blood stops flowing in the and the oxygen stuff's been delivered that the quantum information might dissipate
54:21
to the universe at large but remain entangled as something like a Quantum Soul now I don't suggest any evidence
54:27
for that I don't I I won't disbelieve it I I think it may be true but I'm not
54:33
claiming that I'm just claiming that it's not impossible and that anybody who says that it's absolutely impossible
54:38
it's unscientific until they show exactly what Consciousness is that's they can't they
54:44
can't make that claim if Consciousness is non-local and a Quantum effect uh connects to the fundamental space-time
54:49
geometry then things like auto body near death and uh afterlife are not
54:54
impossible no very good and I mean there's so much you know just wide open
55:00
you know Blue Sky stuff that we could talk about I mean I'm thinking as you're talking uh you know there's a whole
55:05
subset there's a gentleman named mogadot who I'd like to get on the podcast he worked at Google X and tragically lost
55:11
his son very early and his uh son's life and he dedicated his life to making the world happier place and he's got this
55:18
mission called one billion happy so you know mo if you're out there I'd love to have you on um but one of the things he talks about is you know the improbability of things
55:25
that we take is mundane even Consciousness and I was thinking you know what if uh if if any of these
55:31
models are true it could be the Consciousness lasts I mean certainly microtubules are dividing a second after
55:37
a person dies right or whatever that means brain Dead versus heart dead we could discuss that there's still
55:42
processes happening if it's happening in a plant that's attached to the ground you know by the time causality takes it
55:48
takes quite a bit of time for the message to get to the toenail that you've stopped being alive right so
55:54
could you extend this and give hope to people of Wall Street that's where some of the danger lies though right because
55:59
people project anything they want onto these I mean some of the questions I didn't ask are really out there
56:04
um you know and it's uh Curious to me how you navigate this realm you know of scientific scientific approach and using
56:11
it as a discipline that's falsifiable potentially in the paparian sense uh that's you know uh the bio
56:17
neurobiological obviously but then you mentioned parapsychology and a spoon bending and stuff no you didn't mention
56:24
it no you would never do it but but you did you did mention parapsychology so the question is you know how do you how
56:29
does a serious scientist you know kind of navigate these very fraught Shoals of you know kind of non-seudoscientists
56:36
where you know Quantum healing can cure cancer or whatever versus doing a rigorous hardcore science that you're
56:42
known for how do you well you're putting a few words in my mouth but but I did I I do believe that it's possible after
56:47
life is possible I don't Advocate that it's true I don't know um but until we know what Consciousness
56:54
is we can't say that it doesn't exist and uh if it's a non-local Quantum effect then then it's possible but the
57:00
reason I can even talk about that is that I don't I don't depend on grants you know pleasing anybody who has their
57:07
own preconceived notions uh I I know I've run a foul of AI people I've run a foul of a lot of uh funding uh agencies
57:15
who I think have ulterior motives and eight and their own agendas whether they admit it or not but I you know I've
57:21
always made my living as an anesthesiologist and uh and I this has been my I won't say my hobby but my
57:28
passion and my research and uh figure out anesthesia figuring out Consciousness and so I've been able to
57:34
follow my nose and say what I I think whether it's whether it's going to cut off funding or not that because I don't
57:40
really depend on funding yeah so and then and Roger is the same way I mean he just says what he you know logically
57:46
thinks yeah no I know you guys are courageous and last time I asked you when you're on the podcast I asked you
57:52
uh for the advice to your former self which is my way of of bringing back to the podcast the name originally given to
58:00
us by uh Sir Arthur C Clarke who said the following he said that uh the only way to know the limits of the possible
58:05
is to go beyond them into the impossible so ITI and I asked you that in the form
58:10
of advice to your former self what would you give your advice to your former self as 20 year old man to give yourself the
58:17
courage to do what you've done have this courageous career so you answer that question now I'm going to ask you another question uh that's another quip
58:24
of the great Sir Arthur C Clarke and he said that um when an elderly not calling
58:29
you elderly you're older than me you're gonna retire you're Emeritus but um when an elderly but distinguished you
58:35
aren't distinguished scientists says something is possible he or she is very likely to be right but when he or she
58:43
says something is impossible they are very likely to be wrong I want to ask you uh Stewart Professor hammeroff what
58:51
have you changed your mind about what have you been wrong about say in the modern you know incarnation of your
58:56
career not before you met sir Roger and in this field of Consciousness research studies what have you been wrong about
59:03
if anything I don't know can I get back to you I don't want to sound arrogant but I but you know the major things like
59:09
microtubules and Quantum and people you know particularly lately of trying to
59:14
say well you know you get a great model of quantum coherence and microtubes you don't need objective reduction you know
59:20
quantum gravity even you kind of sneered at it and the energy is so low Roger had a good explanation for that and uh I
59:27
just think that it's it's it's logical it makes sense to me the numbers seem to work and uh it's the only uh proposal
59:34
for for Claudia for Consciousness ever ever put forth so I think I was right
59:39
latching onto microtubules as the key to Consciousness and I think I was right in agreeing with Roger and I think he was
59:45
right in agreeing with me very nice well Stewart hammeroff Professor hammeroff University of Arizona azoney
Outro
59:52
self-declared Sony uh Zoni zombie no no you're not a zombie uh thank you so much
59:57
for coming back on the into the impossible podcast for your second appearance I hope that you'll come back again for a third fourth fifth in the
1:00:03
future whenever you come to uh Southern California you're always welcome and we always uh learn so much from you and
1:00:09
broaden our Horizons uh and uh and take us on a tour of the inner Cosmos the
1:00:15
cosmos between our ears as we study I like this yeah the inner Cosmic feel
1:00:21
free to use it you use the Astro Consciousness right so yes very good well thank you so much thank
1:00:27
you Brian
