which are as it were the three legs upon which the whole western tradition rested. These are not confined to the enlightenment although the enlightenment gave a particular version transformed them in a particular manner.
These three principles are roughly these that all genuine questions can be answered. That if a question cannot be answered it is not a question. 
We may not know what the answer is someone else will we may be too weak or too stupid or too ignorant to be able to discover the answer for ourselves in that case the answer may perhaps be known to persons wiser than we experts in the elite of some sort we may be sinful creatures and therefore incapable of ever arriving at the truth by ourselves in that case we shall not know it in this world but perhaps will in the next or perhaps it was known as some golden age before the fall and the flood had rendered us as weak and as sinful as we are or perhaps the golden age is not in the past but in the future and we shall discover the truth then.
If not here there, if not now at some other time but in principle the answer must be known if not to men that attenuate to an omniscient being to god. If the answer is not noble at all if the answer is in some way is in principle shrouded from us then there must be something wrong with the question.
This is a proposition which is common both to christian and to scholastic to enlightenment and to positivist tradition of today it is in fact the backbone of what might be called the main western tradition and it is this that romanticism in a certain sense cracked the second proposition is that all these answers are knowable let's say they can be discovered by means which can be learned and taught to other persons though there are techniques by which it is possible to learn and to teach ways of discovering what the world consists of what part we occupy in it what our relation is to people what our relation is to things what true values are and every other serious and answerable question.
The third proposition is that all the answers must be compatible with one another because if they aren't compatible then chaos will result it is clear that the true answer to one question cannot be incompatible with a true answer to another question it is a logical truth that one true proposition cannot contradict another if all answers to all questions are to be put in the form of propositions and if all true propositions are in principle discoverable then it must follow that there is a description of an ideal universe a utopia if you like which simply is that which is described by all true answers to all serious questions and this utopia is something which although we may not be able to attain to it attenuate is that ideal in terms of which we can measure off our own present imperfections that is the general presupposition if you like of the rationalist western tradition whether christian or pagan were the theist or atheist now the particular twist which the enlightenment gave to it was to say that the answers were not to be obtained in many of the hitherto traditional ways i needn't dwell on that for it will be familiar to most people here the answer is not to be obtained by revelation for different men's revelations appear to contradict each other then it's not to be obtained by tradition because tradition can be shown to be often misleading and false it is not to be obtained by dogma it is not to be obtained by individual self-inspectionof men of a privileged type because too many impostors have used up this role and so forth there is only one way of discovering these answers and that is by the correct use of reason deductively as in the mathematical sciences inductively as in the sciences of nature that is the only way in which answers in general true answers to serious questions.
